PART ONE
Chapter I
The Bertolini
“The Signora had no business to do it,” said Miss Bartlett, “no
business at all. She promised us south rooms with a view close
together, instead of which here are north rooms, looking into a
courtyard, and a long way apart. Oh, Lucy!”
“And a Cockney, besides!” said Lucy, who had been further saddened by
the Signora’s unexpected accent. “It might be London.” She looked at
the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table; at the
row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between
the English people; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late
Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people, heavily framed; at
the notice of the English church (Rev. Cuthbert Eager, M. A. Oxon.),
that was the only other decoration of the wall. “Charlotte, don’t you
feel, too, that we might be in London? I can hardly believe that all
kinds of other things are just outside. I suppose it is one’s being so
tired.”
“This meat has surely been used for soup,” said Miss Bartlett, laying
down her fork.
“I want so to see the Arno. The rooms the Signora promised us in her
letter would have looked over the Arno. The Signora had no business to
do it at all. Oh, it is a shame!”
“Any nook does for me,” Miss Bartlett continued; “but it does seem hard
that you shouldn’t have a view.”
Lucy felt that she had been selfish. “Charlotte, you mustn’t spoil me:
of course, you must look over the Arno, too. I meant that. The first
vacant room in the front—” “You must have it,” said Miss Bartlett, part
of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy’s mother—a piece of
generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion.
“No, no. You must have it.”
“I insist on it. Your mother would never forgive me, Lucy.”
“She would never forgive _me_.”
The ladies’ voices grew animated, and—if the sad truth be owned—a
little peevish. They were tired, and under the guise of unselfishness
they wrangled. Some of their neighbours interchanged glances, and one
of them—one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad—leant
forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument. He
said:
“I have a view, I have a view.”
Miss Bartlett was startled. Generally at a pension people looked them
over for a day or two before speaking, and often did not find out that
they would “do” till they had gone. She knew that the intruder was
ill-bred, even before she glanced at him. He was an old man, of heavy
build, with a fair, shaven face and large eyes. There was something
childish in those eyes, though it was not the childishness of senility.
What exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider, for her
glance passed on to his clothes. These did not attract her. He was
probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the
swim. So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her, and then
said: “A view? Oh, a view! How delightful a view is!”
“This is my son,” said the old man; “his name’s George. He has a view
too.”
“Ah,” said Miss Bartlett, repressing Lucy, who was about to speak.
“What I mean,” he continued, “is that you can have our rooms, and we’ll
have yours. We’ll change.”
The better class of tourist was shocked at this, and sympathized with
the new-comers. Miss Bartlett, in reply, opened her mouth as little as
possible, and said “Thank you very much indeed; that is out of the
question.”
“Why?” said the old man, with both fists on the table.
“Because it is quite out of the question, thank you.”
“You see, we don’t like to take—” began Lucy. Her cousin again
repressed her.
“But why?” he persisted. “Women like looking at a view; men don’t.” And
he thumped with his fists like a naughty child, and turned to his son,
saying, “George, persuade them!”
“It’s so obvious they should have the rooms,” said the son. “There’s
nothing else to say.”
He did not look at the ladies as he spoke, but his voice was perplexed
and sorrowful. Lucy, too, was perplexed; but she saw that they were in
for what is known as “quite a scene,” and she had an odd feeling that
whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened
till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with—well, with something
quite different, whose existence she had not realized before. Now the
old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently: Why should she not
change? What possible objection had she? They would clear out in half
an hour.
Miss Bartlett, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation, was
powerless in the presence of brutality. It was impossible to snub any
one so gross. Her face reddened with displeasure. She looked around as
much as to say, “Are you all like this?” And two little old ladies, who
were sitting further up the table, with shawls hanging over the backs
of the chairs, looked back, clearly indicating “We are not; we are
genteel.”
“Eat your dinner, dear,” she said to Lucy, and began to toy again with
the meat that she had once censured.
Lucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite.
“Eat your dinner, dear. This pension is a failure. To-morrow we will
make a change.”
Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. The
curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout
but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,
cheerfully apologizing for his lateness. Lucy, who had not yet acquired
decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: “Oh, oh! Why, it’s Mr.
Beebe! Oh, how perfectly lovely! Oh, Charlotte, we must stop now,
however bad the rooms are. Oh!”
Miss Bartlett said, with more restraint:
“How do you do, Mr. Beebe? I expect that you have forgotten us: Miss
Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you
helped the Vicar of St. Peter’s that very cold Easter.”
The clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember
the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. But he came forward
pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by
Lucy.
“I _am_ so glad to see you,” said the girl, who was in a state of
spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if her
cousin had permitted it. “Just fancy how small the world is. Summer
Street, too, makes it so specially funny.”
“Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street,” said Miss
Bartlett, filling up the gap, “and she happened to tell me in the
course of conversation that you have just accepted the living—”
“Yes, I heard from mother so last week. She didn’t know that I knew you
at Tunbridge Wells; but I wrote back at once, and I said: ‘Mr. Beebe
is—’”
“Quite right,” said the clergyman. “I move into the Rectory at Summer
Street next June. I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming
neighbourhood.”
“Oh, how glad I am! The name of our house is Windy Corner.” Mr. Beebe
bowed.
“There is mother and me generally, and my brother, though it’s not
often we get him to ch—— The church is rather far off, I mean.”
“Lucy, dearest, let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner.”
“I am eating it, thank you, and enjoying it.”
He preferred to talk to Lucy, whose playing he remembered, rather than
to Miss Bartlett, who probably remembered his sermons. He asked the
girl whether she knew Florence well, and was informed at some length
that she had never been there before. It is delightful to advise a
newcomer, and he was first in the field. “Don’t neglect the country
round,” his advice concluded. “The first fine afternoon drive up to
Fiesole, and round by Settignano, or something of that sort.”
“No!” cried a voice from the top of the table. “Mr. Beebe, you are
wrong. The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato.”
“That lady looks so clever,” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin. “We
are in luck.”
And, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. People
told them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams,
how to get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter,
how much the place would grow upon them. The Pension Bertolini had
decided, almost enthusiastically, that they would do. Whichever way
they looked, kind ladies smiled and shouted at them. And above all rose
the voice of the clever lady, crying: “Prato! They must go to Prato.
That place is too sweetly squalid for words. I love it; I revel in
shaking off the trammels of respectability, as you know.”
The young man named George glanced at the clever lady, and then
returned moodily to his plate. Obviously he and his father did not do.
Lucy, in the midst of her success, found time to wish they did. It gave
her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold; and when
she rose to go, she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous
little bow.
The father did not see it; the son acknowledged it, not by another bow,
but by raising his eyebrows and smiling; he seemed to be smiling across
something.
She hastened after her cousin, who had already disappeared through the
curtains—curtains which smote one in the face, and seemed heavy with
more than cloth. Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora, bowing
good-evening to her guests, and supported by ’Enery, her little boy,
and Victorier, her daughter. It made a curious little scene, this
attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South.
And even more curious was the drawing-room, which attempted to rival
the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house. Was this really
Italy?
Miss Bartlett was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair, which
had the colour and the contours of a tomato. She was talking to Mr.
Beebe, and as she spoke, her long narrow head drove backwards and
forwards, slowly, regularly, as though she were demolishing some
invisible obstacle. “We are most grateful to you,” she was saying. “The
first evening means so much. When you arrived we were in for a
peculiarly _mauvais quart d’heure_.”
He expressed his regret.
“Do you, by any chance, know the name of an old man who sat opposite us
at dinner?”
“Emerson.”
“Is he a friend of yours?”
“We are friendly—as one is in pensions.”
“Then I will say no more.”
He pressed her very slightly, and she said more.
“I am, as it were,” she concluded, “the chaperon of my young cousin,
Lucy, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation
to people of whom we know nothing. His manner was somewhat unfortunate.
I hope I acted for the best.”
“You acted very naturally,” said he. He seemed thoughtful, and after a
few moments added: “All the same, I don’t think much harm would have
come of accepting.”
“No _harm_, of course. But we could not be under an obligation.”
“He is rather a peculiar man.” Again he hesitated, and then said
gently: “I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance, nor
expect you to show gratitude. He has the merit—if it is one—of saying
exactly what he means. He has rooms he does not value, and he thinks
you would value them. He no more thought of putting you under an
obligation than he thought of being polite. It is so difficult—at
least, I find it difficult—to understand people who speak the truth.”
Lucy was pleased, and said: “I was hoping that he was nice; I do so
always hope that people will be nice.”
“I think he is; nice and tiresome. I differ from him on almost every
point of any importance, and so, I expect—I may say I hope—you will
differ. But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores. When
he first came here he not unnaturally put people’s backs up. He has no
tact and no manners—I don’t mean by that that he has bad manners—and he
will not keep his opinions to himself. We nearly complained about him
to our depressing Signora, but I am glad to say we thought better of
it.”
“Am I to conclude,” said Miss Bartlett, “that he is a Socialist?”
Mr. Beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching
of the lips.
“And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist, too?”
“I hardly know George, for he hasn’t learnt to talk yet. He seems a
nice creature, and I think he has brains. Of course, he has all his
father’s mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a
Socialist.”
“Oh, you relieve me,” said Miss Bartlett. “So you think I ought to have
accepted their offer? You feel I have been narrow-minded and
suspicious?”
“Not at all,” he answered; “I never suggested that.”
“But ought I not to apologize, at all events, for my apparent
rudeness?”
He replied, with some irritation, that it would be quite unnecessary,
and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room.
“Was I a bore?” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had disappeared. “Why
didn’t you talk, Lucy? He prefers young people, I’m sure. I do hope I
haven’t monopolized him. I hoped you would have him all the evening, as
well as all dinner-time.”
“He is nice,” exclaimed Lucy. “Just what I remember. He seems to see
good in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.”
“My dear Lucia—”
“Well, you know what I mean. And you know how clergymen generally
laugh; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.”
“Funny girl! How you do remind me of your mother. I wonder if she will
approve of Mr. Beebe.”
“I’m sure she will; and so will Freddy.”
“I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve; it is the fashionable
world. I am used to Tunbridge Wells, where we are all hopelessly behind
the times.”
“Yes,” said Lucy despondently.
There was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval
was of herself, or of Mr. Beebe, or of the fashionable world at Windy
Corner, or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells, she could not
determine. She tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. Miss
Bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added “I am
afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.”
And the girl again thought: “I must have been selfish or unkind; I must
be more careful. It is so dreadful for Charlotte, being poor.”
Fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been
smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed
to sit where Mr. Beebe had sat. Permission granted, she began to
chatter gently about Italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the
gratifying success of the plunge, the improvement in her sister’s
health, the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of
thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning. She handled her
subjects agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention
than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was
proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room. It was a real
catastrophe, not a mere episode, that evening of hers at Venice, when
she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea,
though one better than something else.
“But here you are as safe as in England. Signora Bertolini is so
English.”
“Yet our rooms smell,” said poor Lucy. “We dread going to bed.”
“Ah, then you look into the court.” She sighed. “If only Mr. Emerson
was more tactful! We were so sorry for you at dinner.”
“I think he was meaning to be kind.”
“Undoubtedly he was,” said Miss Bartlett.
“Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. Of
course, I was holding back on my cousin’s account.”
“Of course,” said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could
not be too careful with a young girl.
Lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. No
one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not
noticed it.
“About old Mr. Emerson—I hardly know. No, he is not tactful; yet, have
you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most
indelicate, and yet at the same time—beautiful?”
“Beautiful?” said Miss Bartlett, puzzled at the word. “Are not beauty
and delicacy the same?”
“So one would have thought,” said the other helplessly. “But things are
so difficult, I sometimes think.”
She proceeded no further into things, for Mr. Beebe reappeared, looking
extremely pleasant.
“Miss Bartlett,” he cried, “it’s all right about the rooms. I’m so
glad. Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing
what I did, I encouraged him to make the offer again. He has let me
come and ask you. He would be so pleased.”
“Oh, Charlotte,” cried Lucy to her cousin, “we must have the rooms now.
The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.”
Miss Bartlett was silent.
“I fear,” said Mr. Beebe, after a pause, “that I have been officious. I
must apologize for my interference.”
Gravely displeased, he turned to go. Not till then did Miss Bartlett
reply: “My own wishes, dearest Lucy, are unimportant in comparison with
yours. It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at
Florence, when I am only here through your kindness. If you wish me to
turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, I will do it. Would you then,
Mr. Beebe, kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer, and
then conduct him to me, in order that I may thank him personally?”
She raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the
drawing-room, and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines. The
clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with
her message.
“Remember, Lucy, I alone am implicated in this. I do not wish the
acceptance to come from you. Grant me that, at all events.”
Mr. Beebe was back, saying rather nervously:
“Mr. Emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.”
The young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the
floor, so low were their chairs.
“My father,” he said, “is in his bath, so you cannot thank him
personally. But any message given by you to me will be given by me to
him as soon as he comes out.”
Miss Bartlett was unequal to the bath. All her barbed civilities came
forth wrong end first. Young Mr. Emerson scored a notable triumph to
the delight of Mr. Beebe and to the secret delight of Lucy.
“Poor young man!” said Miss Bartlett, as soon as he had gone.
“How angry he is with his father about the rooms! It is all he can do
to keep polite.”
“In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,” said Mr. Beebe. Then
looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own
rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.
“Oh, dear!” breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the
winds of heaven had entered the apartment. “Gentlemen sometimes do not
realize—” Her voice faded away, but Miss Bartlett seemed to understand
and a conversation developed, in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly
realize played a principal part. Lucy, not realizing either, was
reduced to literature. Taking up Baedeker’s Handbook to Northern Italy,
she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History.
For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow. Thus the
half-hour crept profitably away, and at last Miss Bartlett rose with a
sigh, and said:
“I think one might venture now. No, Lucy, do not stir. I will
superintend the move.”
“How you do do everything,” said Lucy.
“Naturally, dear. It is my affair.”
“But I would like to help you.”
“No, dear.”
Charlotte’s energy! And her unselfishness! She had been thus all her
life, but really, on this Italian tour, she was surpassing herself. So
Lucy felt, or strove to feel. And yet—there was a rebellious spirit in
her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less
delicate and more beautiful. At all events, she entered her own room
without any feeling of joy.
“I want to explain,” said Miss Bartlett, “why it is that I have taken
the largest room. Naturally, of course, I should have given it to you;
but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and I was sure
your mother would not like it.”
Lucy was bewildered.
“If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under
an obligation to his father than to him. I am a woman of the world, in
my small way, and I know where things lead to. However, Mr. Beebe is a
guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.”
“Mother wouldn’t mind I’m sure,” said Lucy, but again had the sense of
larger and unsuspected issues.
Miss Bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as
she wished her good-night. It gave Lucy the sensation of a fog, and
when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the
clean night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to
see the lights dancing in the Arno and the cypresses of San Miniato,
and the foot-hills of the Apennines, black against the rising moon.
Miss Bartlett, in her room, fastened the window-shutters and locked the
door, and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards
led, and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances. It was
then that she saw, pinned up over the washstand, a sheet of paper on
which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation. Nothing more.
“What does it mean?” she thought, and she examined it carefully by the
light of a candle. Meaningless at first, it gradually became menacing,
obnoxious, portentous with evil. She was seized with an impulse to
destroy it, but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so,
since it must be the property of young Mr. Emerson. So she unpinned it
carefully, and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it
clean for him. Then she completed her inspection of the room, sighed
heavily according to her habit, and went to bed.
Chapter II
In Santa Croce with No Baedeker
It was pleasant to wake up in Florence, to open the eyes upon a bright
bare room, with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are
not; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini
sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons. It was pleasant, too,
to fling wide the windows, pinching the fingers in unfamiliar
fastenings, to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees
and marble churches opposite, and close below, the Arno, gurgling
against the embankment of the road.
Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy
foreshore, and on the river was a boat, also diligently employed for
some mysterious end. An electric tram came rushing underneath the
window. No one was inside it, except one tourist; but its platforms
were overflowing with Italians, who preferred to stand. Children tried
to hang on behind, and the conductor, with no malice, spat in their
faces to make them let go. Then soldiers appeared—good-looking,
undersized men—wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur, and a
great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier. Beside them
walked officers, looking foolish and fierce, and before them went
little boys, turning somersaults in time with the band. The tramcar
became entangled in their ranks, and moved on painfully, like a
caterpillar in a swarm of ants. One of the little boys fell down, and
some white bullocks came out of an archway. Indeed, if it had not been
for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks, the
road might never have got clear.
Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away, and
the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of
Giotto, or the corruption of the Papacy, may return remembering nothing
but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it. So it was as
well that Miss Bartlett should tap and come in, and having commented on
Lucy’s leaving the door unlocked, and on her leaning out of the window
before she was fully dressed, should urge her to hasten herself, or the
best of the day would be gone. By the time Lucy was ready her cousin
had done her breakfast, and was listening to the clever lady among the
crumbs.
A conversation then ensued, on not unfamiliar lines. Miss Bartlett was,
after all, a wee bit tired, and thought they had better spend the
morning settling in; unless Lucy would at all like to go out? Lucy
would rather like to go out, as it was her first day in Florence, but,
of course, she could go alone. Miss Bartlett could not allow this. Of
course she would accompany Lucy everywhere. Oh, certainly not; Lucy
would stop with her cousin. Oh, no! that would never do. Oh, yes!
At this point the clever lady broke in.
“If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you, I do assure you that you
can neglect the good person. Being English, Miss Honeychurch will be
perfectly safe. Italians understand. A dear friend of mine, Contessa
Baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to
school with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. Every one
takes them for English, you see, especially if their hair is strained
tightly behind.”
Miss Bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli’s
daughters. She was determined to take Lucy herself, her head not being
so very bad. The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a
long morning in Santa Croce, and if Lucy would come too, she would be
delighted.
“I will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you
bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.”
Lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the Baedeker, to
see where Santa Croce was.
“Tut, tut! Miss Lucy! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from
Baedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true
Italy—he does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found
by patient observation.”
This sounded very interesting, and Lucy hurried over her breakfast, and
started with her new friend in high spirits. Italy was coming at last.
The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream.
Miss Lavish—for that was the clever lady’s name—turned to the right
along the sunny Lung’ Arno. How delightfully warm! But a wind down the
side streets cut like a knife, didn’t it? Ponte alle
Grazie—particularly interesting, mentioned by Dante. San
Miniato—beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed a
murderer—Miss Honeychurch would remember the story. The men on the
river were fishing. (Untrue; but then, so is most information.) Then
Miss Lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she
stopped, and she cried:
“A smell! a true Florentine smell! Every city, let me teach you, has
its own smell.”
“Is it a very nice smell?” said Lucy, who had inherited from her mother
a distaste to dirt.
“One doesn’t come to Italy for niceness,” was the retort; “one comes
for life. Buon giorno! Buon giorno!” bowing right and left. “Look at
that adorable wine-cart! How the driver stares at us, dear, simple
soul!”
So Miss Lavish proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence,
short, fidgety, and playful as a kitten, though without a kitten’s
grace. It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so
cheerful; and a blue military cloak, such as an Italian officer wears,
only increased the sense of festivity.
“Buon giorno! Take the word of an old woman, Miss Lucy: you will never
repent of a little civility to your inferiors. _That_ is the true
democracy. Though I am a real Radical as well. There, now you’re
shocked.”
“Indeed, I’m not!” exclaimed Lucy. “We are Radicals, too, out and out.
My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone, until he was so dreadful
about Ireland.”
“I see, I see. And now you have gone over to the enemy.”
“Oh, please—! If my father was alive, I am sure he would vote Radical
again now that Ireland is all right. And as it is, the glass over our
front door was broken last election, and Freddy is sure it was the
Tories; but mother says nonsense, a tramp.”
“Shameful! A manufacturing district, I suppose?”
“No—in the Surrey hills. About five miles from Dorking, looking over
the Weald.”
Miss Lavish seemed interested, and slackened her trot.
“What a delightful part; I know it so well. It is full of the very
nicest people. Do you know Sir Harry Otway—a Radical if ever there
was?”
“Very well indeed.”
“And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist?”
“Why, she rents a field of us! How funny!”
Miss Lavish looked at the narrow ribbon of sky, and murmured: “Oh, you
have property in Surrey?”
“Hardly any,” said Lucy, fearful of being thought a snob. “Only thirty
acres—just the garden, all downhill, and some fields.”
Miss Lavish was not disgusted, and said it was just the size of her
aunt’s Suffolk estate. Italy receded. They tried to remember the last
name of Lady Louisa someone, who had taken a house near Summer Street
the other year, but she had not liked it, which was odd of her. And
just as Miss Lavish had got the name, she broke off and exclaimed:
“Bless us! Bless us and save us! We’ve lost the way.”
Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce, the
tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window. But
Miss Lavish had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart, that
Lucy had followed her with no misgivings.
“Lost! lost! My dear Miss Lucy, during our political diatribes we have
taken a wrong turning. How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us!
What are we to do? Two lone females in an unknown town. Now, this is
what _I_ call an adventure.”
Lucy, who wanted to see Santa Croce, suggested, as a possible solution,
that they should ask the way there.
“Oh, but that is the word of a craven! And no, you are not, not, _not_
to look at your Baedeker. Give it to me; I shan’t let you carry it. We
will simply drift.”
Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets,
neither commodious nor picturesque, in which the eastern quarter of the
city abounds. Lucy soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa,
and became discontented herself. For one ravishing moment Italy
appeared. She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the
living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can
ever stale. There they stood, with their shining limbs bursting from
the garments of charity, and their strong white arms extended against
circlets of heaven. Lucy thought she had never seen anything more
beautiful; but Miss Lavish, with a shriek of dismay, dragged her
forward, declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a
mile.
The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins, or
rather ceases, to tell, and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste
out of a little shop, because it looked so typical. It tasted partly of
the paper in which it was wrapped, partly of hair oil, partly of the
great unknown. But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza,
large and dusty, on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white
façade of surpassing ugliness. Miss Lavish spoke to it dramatically. It
was Santa Croce. The adventure was over.
“Stop a minute; let those two people go on, or I shall have to speak to
them. I do detest conventional intercourse. Nasty! they are going into
the church, too. Oh, the Britisher abroad!”
“We sat opposite them at dinner last night. They have given us their
rooms. They were so very kind.”
“Look at their figures!” laughed Miss Lavish. “They walk through my
Italy like a pair of cows. It’s very naughty of me, but I would like to
set an examination paper at Dover, and turn back every tourist who
couldn’t pass it.”
“What would you ask us?”
Miss Lavish laid her hand pleasantly on Lucy’s arm, as if to suggest
that she, at all events, would get full marks. In this exalted mood
they reached the steps of the great church, and were about to enter it
when Miss Lavish stopped, squeaked, flung up her arms, and cried:
“There goes my local-colour box! I must have a word with him!”
And in a moment she was away over the Piazza, her military cloak
flapping in the wind; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an
old man with white whiskers, and nipped him playfully upon the arm.
Lucy waited for nearly ten minutes. Then she began to get tired. The
beggars worried her, the dust blew in her eyes, and she remembered that
a young girl ought not to loiter in public places. She descended slowly
into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining Miss Lavish, who was
really almost too original. But at that moment Miss Lavish and her
local-colour box moved also, and disappeared down a side street, both
gesticulating largely. Tears of indignation came to Lucy’s eyes partly
because Miss Lavish had jilted her, partly because she had taken her
Baedeker. How could she find her way home? How could she find her way
about in Santa Croce? Her first morning was ruined, and she might never
be in Florence again. A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits,
talking as a woman of culture, and half persuading herself that she was
full of originality. Now she entered the church depressed and
humiliated, not even able to remember whether it was built by the
Franciscans or the Dominicans. Of course, it must be a wonderful
building. But how like a barn! And how very cold! Of course, it
contained frescoes by Giotto, in the presence of whose tactile values
she was capable of feeling what was proper. But who was to tell her
which they were? She walked about disdainfully, unwilling to be
enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date. There was
no one even to tell her which, of all the sepulchral slabs that paved
the nave and transepts, was the one that was really beautiful, the one
that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin.
Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her, and, instead of
acquiring information, she began to be happy. She puzzled out the
Italian notices—the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into
the church—the notice that prayed people, in the interest of health and
out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves,
not to spit. She watched the tourists; their noses were as red as their
Baedekers, so cold was Santa Croce. She beheld the horrible fate that
overtook three Papists—two he-babies and a she-baby—who began their
career by sousing each other with the Holy Water, and then proceeded to
the Machiavelli memorial, dripping but hallowed. Advancing towards it
very slowly and from immense distances, they touched the stone with
their fingers, with their handkerchiefs, with their heads, and then
retreated. What could this mean? They did it again and again. Then Lucy
realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint, hoping to
acquire virtue. Punishment followed quickly. The smallest he-baby
stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr.
Ruskin, and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop.
Protestant as she was, Lucy darted forward. She was too late. He fell
heavily upon the prelate’s upturned toes.
“Hateful bishop!” exclaimed the voice of old Mr. Emerson, who had
darted forward also. “Hard in life, hard in death. Go out into the
sunshine, little boy, and kiss your hand to the sun, for that is where
you ought to be. Intolerable bishop!”
The child screamed frantically at these words, and at these dreadful
people who picked him up, dusted him, rubbed his bruises, and told him
not to be superstitious.
“Look at him!” said Mr. Emerson to Lucy. “Here’s a mess: a baby hurt,
cold, and frightened! But what else can you expect from a church?”
The child’s legs had become as melting wax. Each time that old Mr.
Emerson and Lucy set it erect it collapsed with a roar. Fortunately an
Italian lady, who ought to have been saying her prayers, came to the
rescue. By some mysterious virtue, which mothers alone possess, she
stiffened the little boy’s back-bone and imparted strength to his
knees. He stood. Still gibbering with agitation, he walked away.
“You are a clever woman,” said Mr. Emerson. “You have done more than
all the relics in the world. I am not of your creed, but I do believe
in those who make their fellow-creatures happy. There is no scheme of
the universe—”
He paused for a phrase.
“Niente,” said the Italian lady, and returned to her prayers.
“I’m not sure she understands English,” suggested Lucy.
In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons. She was
determined to be gracious to them, beautiful rather than delicate, and,
if possible, to erase Miss Bartlett’s civility by some gracious
reference to the pleasant rooms.
“That woman understands everything,” was Mr. Emerson’s reply. “But what
are you doing here? Are you doing the church? Are you through with the
church?”
“No,” cried Lucy, remembering her grievance. “I came here with Miss
Lavish, who was to explain everything; and just by the door—it is too
bad!—she simply ran away, and after waiting quite a time, I had to come
in by myself.”
“Why shouldn’t you?” said Mr. Emerson.
“Yes, why shouldn’t you come by yourself?” said the son, addressing the
young lady for the first time.
“But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker.”
“Baedeker?” said Mr. Emerson. “I’m glad it’s _that_ you minded. It’s
worth minding, the loss of a Baedeker. _That’s_ worth minding.”
Lucy was puzzled. She was again conscious of some new idea, and was not
sure whither it would lead her.
“If you’ve no Baedeker,” said the son, “you’d better join us.” Was this
where the idea would lead? She took refuge in her dignity.
“Thank you very much, but I could not think of that. I hope you do not
suppose that I came to join on to you. I really came to help with the
child, and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night.
I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience.”
“My dear,” said the old man gently, “I think that you are repeating
what you have heard older people say. You are pretending to be touchy;
but you are not really. Stop being so tiresome, and tell me instead
what part of the church you want to see. To take you to it will be a
real pleasure.”
Now, this was abominably impertinent, and she ought to have been
furious. But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one’s temper as it is
difficult at other times to keep it. Lucy could not get cross. Mr.
Emerson was an old man, and surely a girl might humour him. On the
other hand, his son was a young man, and she felt that a girl ought to
be offended with him, or at all events be offended before him. It was
at him that she gazed before replying.
“I am not touchy, I hope. It is the Giottos that I want to see, if you
will kindly tell me which they are.”
The son nodded. With a look of sombre satisfaction, he led the way to
the Peruzzi Chapel. There was a hint of the teacher about him. She felt
like a child in school who had answered a question rightly.
The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation, and out of
them rose the voice of a lecturer, directing them how to worship
Giotto, not by tactful valuations, but by the standards of the spirit.
“Remember,” he was saying, “the facts about this church of Santa Croce;
how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism, before
any taint of the Renaissance had appeared. Observe how Giotto in these
frescoes—now, unhappily, ruined by restoration—is untroubled by the
snares of anatomy and perspective. Could anything be more majestic,
more pathetic, beautiful, true? How little, we feel, avails knowledge
and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels!”
“No!” exclaimed Mr. Emerson, in much too loud a voice for church.
“Remember nothing of the sort! Built by faith indeed! That simply means
the workmen weren’t paid properly. And as for the frescoes, I see no
truth in them. Look at that fat man in blue! He must weigh as much as I
do, and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon.”
He was referring to the fresco of the “Ascension of St. John.” Inside,
the lecturer’s voice faltered, as well it might. The audience shifted
uneasily, and so did Lucy. She was sure that she ought not to be with
these men; but they had cast a spell over her. They were so serious and
so strange that she could not remember how to behave.
“Now, did this happen, or didn’t it? Yes or no?”
George replied:
“It happened like this, if it happened at all. I would rather go up to
heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs; and if I got there I should
like my friends to lean out of it, just as they do here.”
“You will never go up,” said his father. “You and I, dear boy, will lie
at peace in the earth that bore us, and our names will disappear as
surely as our work survives.”
“Some of the people can only see the empty grave, not the saint,
whoever he is, going up. It did happen like that, if it happened at
all.”
“Pardon me,” said a frigid voice. “The chapel is somewhat small for two
parties. We will incommode you no longer.”
The lecturer was a clergyman, and his audience must be also his flock,
for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands. They
filed out of the chapel in silence. Amongst them were the two little
old ladies of the Pension Bertolini—Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine
Alan.
“Stop!” cried Mr. Emerson. “There’s plenty of room for us all. Stop!”
The procession disappeared without a word.
Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel, describing the
life of St. Francis.
“George, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate.”
George went into the next chapel and returned, saying “Perhaps he is. I
don’t remember.”
“Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am. It’s that Mr.
Eager. Why did he go? Did we talk too loud? How vexatious. I shall go
and say we are sorry. Hadn’t I better? Then perhaps he will come back.”
“He will not come back,” said George.
But Mr. Emerson, contrite and unhappy, hurried away to apologize to the
Rev. Cuthbert Eager. Lucy, apparently absorbed in a lunette, could hear
the lecture again interrupted, the anxious, aggressive voice of the old
man, the curt, injured replies of his opponent. The son, who took every
little contretemps as if it were a tragedy, was listening also.
“My father has that effect on nearly everyone,” he informed her. “He
will try to be kind.”
“I hope we all try,” said she, smiling nervously.
“Because we think it improves our characters. But he is kind to people
because he loves them; and they find him out, and are offended, or
frightened.”
“How silly of them!” said Lucy, though in her heart she sympathized; “I
think that a kind action done tactfully—”
“Tact!”
He threw up his head in disdain. Apparently she had given the wrong
answer. She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel.
For a young man his face was rugged, and—until the shadows fell upon
it—hard. Enshadowed, it sprang into tenderness. She saw him once again
at Rome, on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, carrying a burden of
acorns. Healthy and muscular, he yet gave her the feeling of greyness,
of tragedy that might only find solution in the night. The feeling soon
passed; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle. Born
of silence and of unknown emotion, it passed when Mr. Emerson returned,
and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk, which was alone
familiar to her.
“Were you snubbed?” asked his son tranquilly.
“But we have spoilt the pleasure of I don’t know how many people. They
won’t come back.”
“...full of innate sympathy...quickness to perceive good in
others...vision of the brotherhood of man...” Scraps of the lecture on
St. Francis came floating round the partition wall.
“Don’t let us spoil yours,” he continued to Lucy. “Have you looked at
those saints?”
“Yes,” said Lucy. “They are lovely. Do you know which is the tombstone
that is praised in Ruskin?”
He did not know, and suggested that they should try to guess it.
George, rather to her relief, refused to move, and she and the old man
wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce, which, though it is like a
barn, has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls. There were
also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars, and an old
lady with her dog, and here and there a priest modestly edging to his
Mass through the groups of tourists. But Mr. Emerson was only half
interested. He watched the lecturer, whose success he believed he had
impaired, and then he anxiously watched his son.
“Why will he look at that fresco?” he said uneasily. “I saw nothing in
it.”
“I like Giotto,” she replied. “It is so wonderful what they say about
his tactile values. Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies
better.”
“So you ought. A baby is worth a dozen saints. And my baby’s worth the
whole of Paradise, and as far as I can see he lives in Hell.”
Lucy again felt that this did not do.
“In Hell,” he repeated. “He’s unhappy.”
“Oh, dear!” said Lucy.
“How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive? What more is one to
give him? And think how he has been brought up—free from all the
superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the
name of God. With such an education as that, I thought he was bound to
grow up happy.”
She was no theologian, but she felt that here was a very foolish old
man, as well as a very irreligious one. She also felt that her mother
might not like her talking to that kind of person, and that Charlotte
would object most strongly.
“What are we to do with him?” he asked. “He comes out for his holiday
to Italy, and behaves—like that; like the little child who ought to
have been playing, and who hurt himself upon the tombstone. Eh? What
did you say?”
Lucy had made no suggestion. Suddenly he said:
“Now don’t be stupid over this. I don’t require you to fall in love
with my boy, but I do think you might try and understand him. You are
nearer his age, and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible.
You might help me. He has known so few women, and you have the time.
You stop here several weeks, I suppose? But let yourself go. You are
inclined to get muddled, if I may judge from last night. Let yourself
go. Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand,
and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them. By
understanding George you may learn to understand yourself. It will be
good for both of you.”
To this extraordinary speech Lucy found no answer.
“I only know what it is that’s wrong with him; not why it is.”
“And what is it?” asked Lucy fearfully, expecting some harrowing tale.
“The old trouble; things won’t fit.”
“What things?”
“The things of the universe. It is quite true. They don’t.”
“Oh, Mr. Emerson, whatever do you mean?”
In his ordinary voice, so that she scarcely realized he was quoting
poetry, he said:
“‘From far, from eve and morning,
And yon twelve-winded sky,
The stuff of life to knit me
Blew hither: here am I’
George and I both know this, but why does it distress him? We know that
we come from the winds, and that we shall return to them; that all life
is perhaps a knot, a tangle, a blemish in the eternal smoothness. But
why should this make us unhappy? Let us rather love one another, and
work and rejoice. I don’t believe in this world sorrow.”
Miss Honeychurch assented.
“Then make my boy think like us. Make him realize that by the side of
the everlasting Why there is a Yes—a transitory Yes if you like, but a
Yes.”
Suddenly she laughed; surely one ought to laugh. A young man melancholy
because the universe wouldn’t fit, because life was a tangle or a wind,
or a Yes, or something!
“I’m very sorry,” she cried. “You’ll think me unfeeling, but—but—” Then
she became matronly. “Oh, but your son wants employment. Has he no
particular hobby? Why, I myself have worries, but I can generally
forget them at the piano; and collecting stamps did no end of good for
my brother. Perhaps Italy bores him; you ought to try the Alps or the
Lakes.”
The old man’s face saddened, and he touched her gently with his hand.
This did not alarm her; she thought that her advice had impressed him
and that he was thanking her for it. Indeed, he no longer alarmed her
at all; she regarded him as a kind thing, but quite silly. Her feelings
were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically,
before she lost Baedeker. The dear George, now striding towards them
over the tombstones, seemed both pitiable and absurd. He approached,
his face in the shadow. He said:
“Miss Bartlett.”
“Oh, good gracious me!” said Lucy, suddenly collapsing and again seeing
the whole of life in a new perspective. “Where? Where?”
“In the nave.”
“I see. Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have—” She checked
herself.
“Poor girl!” exploded Mr. Emerson. “Poor girl!”
She could not let this pass, for it was just what she was feeling
herself.
“Poor girl? I fail to understand the point of that remark. I think
myself a very fortunate girl, I assure you. I’m thoroughly happy, and
having a splendid time. Pray don’t waste time mourning over _me_.
There’s enough sorrow in the world, isn’t there, without trying to
invent it. Good-bye. Thank you both so much for all your kindness. Ah,
yes! there does come my cousin. A delightful morning! Santa Croce is a
wonderful church.”
She joined her cousin.
Chapter III
Music, Violets, and the Letter “S”
It so happened that Lucy, who found daily life rather chaotic, entered
a more solid world when she opened the piano. She was then no longer
either deferential or patronizing; no longer either a rebel or a slave.
The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world; it will accept
those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected. The
commonplace person begins to play, and shoots into the empyrean without
effort, whilst we look up, marvelling how he has escaped us, and
thinking how we could worship him and love him, would he but translate
his visions into human words, and his experiences into human actions.
Perhaps he cannot; certainly he does not, or does so very seldom. Lucy
had done so never.
She was no dazzling _exécutante;_ her runs were not at all like strings
of pearls, and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one
of her age and situation. Nor was she the passionate young lady, who
performs so tragically on a summer’s evening with the window open.
Passion was there, but it could not be easily labelled; it slipped
between love and hatred and jealousy, and all the furniture of the
pictorial style. And she was tragical only in the sense that she was
great, for she loved to play on the side of Victory. Victory of what
and over what—that is more than the words of daily life can tell us.
But that some sonatas of Beethoven are written tragic no one can
gainsay; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides, and
Lucy had decided that they should triumph.
A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she
really liked, and after lunch she opened the little draped piano. A few
people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she
made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to
sleep. She took no notice of Mr. Emerson looking for his son, nor of
Miss Bartlett looking for Miss Lavish, nor of Miss Lavish looking for
her cigarette-case. Like every true performer, she was intoxicated by
the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by
touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.
Mr. Beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical
element in Miss Honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge
Wells when he had discovered it. It was at one of those entertainments
where the upper classes entertain the lower. The seats were filled with
a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish,
under the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the
drawing of a champagne cork. Among the promised items was “Miss
Honeychurch. Piano. Beethoven,” and Mr. Beebe was wondering whether it
would be Adelaida, or the march of The Ruins of Athens, when his
composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III. He was in
suspense all through the introduction, for not until the pace quickens
does one know what the performer intends. With the roar of the opening
theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords
that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. He
was glad that she only played the first movement, for he could have
paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of
nine-sixteen. The audience clapped, no less respectful. It was Mr.
Beebe who started the stamping; it was all that one could do.
“Who is she?” he asked the vicar afterwards.
“Cousin of one of my parishioners. I do not consider her choice of a
piece happy. Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal
that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if
anything, disturbs.”
“Introduce me.”
“She will be delighted. She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises
of your sermon.”
“My sermon?” cried Mr. Beebe. “Why ever did she listen to it?”
When he was introduced he understood why, for Miss Honeychurch,
disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity
of dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. She loved going
to concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee
and meringues. He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. But
before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he
now made to Lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved
dreamily towards him:
“If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays, it will be very
exciting both for us and for her.”
Lucy at once re-entered daily life.
“Oh, what a funny thing! Some one said just the same to mother, and she
said she trusted I should never live a duet.”
“Doesn’t Mrs. Honeychurch like music?”
“She doesn’t mind it. But she doesn’t like one to get excited over
anything; she thinks I am silly about it. She thinks—I can’t make out.
Once, you know, I said that I liked my own playing better than any
one’s. She has never got over it. Of course, I didn’t mean that I
played well; I only meant—”
“Of course,” said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.
“Music—” said Lucy, as if attempting some generality. She could not
complete it, and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet. The whole
life of the South was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in
Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.
The street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,
and the hills were dirty purple. Somewhere in their folds were
concealed Miss Lavish and Miss Bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon
to visit the Torre del Gallo.
“What about music?” said Mr. Beebe.
“Poor Charlotte will be sopped,” was Lucy’s reply.
The expedition was typical of Miss Bartlett, who would return cold,
tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy Baedeker, and
a tickling cough in her throat. On another day, when the whole world
was singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse
to stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no
fit companion for a hearty girl.
“Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray. She hopes to find the true
Italy in the wet I believe.”
“Miss Lavish is so original,” murmured Lucy. This was a stock remark,
the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of
definition. Miss Lavish was so original. Mr. Beebe had his doubts, but
they would have been put down to clerical narrowness. For that, and for
other reasons, he held his peace.
“Is it true,” continued Lucy in awe-struck tone, “that Miss Lavish is
writing a book?”
“They do say so.”
“What is it about?”
“It will be a novel,” replied Mr. Beebe, “dealing with modern Italy.
Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan, who uses words
herself more admirably than any one I know.”
“I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself. We started such friends. But
I don’t think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in
Santa Croce. Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically
alone, and so I couldn’t help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish.”
“The two ladies, at all events, have made it up.”
He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently
dissimilar as Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish. They were always in each
other’s company, with Lucy a slighted third. Miss Lavish he believed he
understood, but Miss Bartlett might reveal unknown depths of
strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. Was Italy deflecting her
from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at
Tunbridge Wells? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies; they
were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample
opportunities for the work. Girls like Lucy were charming to look at,
but Mr. Beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his
attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather
than enthralled.
Lucy, for the third time, said that poor Charlotte would be sopped. The
Arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts
upon the foreshore. But in the south-west there had appeared a dull
haze of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean
worse. She opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the
room, drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine Alan, who entered at
the same moment by the door.
“Oh, dear Miss Honeychurch, you will catch a chill! And Mr. Beebe here
besides. Who would suppose this is Italy? There is my sister actually
nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.”
She sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was
on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.
“I could hear your beautiful playing, Miss Honeychurch, though I was in
my room with the door shut. Doors shut; indeed, most necessary. No one
has the least idea of privacy in this country. And one person catches
it from another.”
Lucy answered suitably. Mr. Beebe was not able to tell the ladies of
his adventure at Modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his
bath, exclaiming cheerfully, “Fa niente, sono vecchia.” He contented
himself with saying: “I quite agree with you, Miss Alan. The Italians
are a most unpleasant people. They pry everywhere, they see everything,
and they know what we want before we know it ourselves. We are at their
mercy. They read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. From the
cab-driver down to—to Giotto, they turn us inside out, and I resent it.
Yet in their heart of hearts they are—how superficial! They have no
conception of the intellectual life. How right is Signora Bertolini,
who exclaimed to me the other day: ‘Ho, Mr. Beebe, if you knew what I
suffer over the children’s edjucaishion. _Hi_ won’t ’ave my little
Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can’t explain nothink!’”
Miss Alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an
agreeable way. Her sister was a little disappointed in Mr. Beebe,
having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and
who wore a pair of russet whiskers. Indeed, who would have supposed
that tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour would inhabit that
militant form?
In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last
the cause was disclosed. From the chair beneath her she extracted a
gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the
initials “E. L.”
“That belongs to Lavish.” said the clergyman. “A good fellow, Lavish,
but I wish she’d start a pipe.”
“Oh, Mr. Beebe,” said Miss Alan, divided between awe and mirth.
“Indeed, though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as
dreadful as you suppose. She took to it, practically in despair, after
her life’s work was carried away in a landslip. Surely that makes it
more excusable.”
“What was that?” asked Lucy.
Mr. Beebe sat back complacently, and Miss Alan began as follows: “It
was a novel—and I am afraid, from what I can gather, not a very nice
novel. It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them, and I
must say they nearly always do. Anyhow, she left it almost finished in
the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she
went for a little ink. She said: ‘Can I have a little ink, please?’ But
you know what Italians are, and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to
the beach, and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember
what she has written. The poor thing was very ill after it, and so got
tempted into cigarettes. It is a great secret, but I am glad to say
that she is writing another novel. She told Teresa and Miss Pole the
other day that she had got up all the local colour—this novel is to be
about modern Italy; the other was historical—but that she could not
start till she had an idea. First she tried Perugia for an inspiration,
then she came here—this must on no account get round. And so cheerful
through it all! I cannot help thinking that there is something to
admire in everyone, even if you do not approve of them.”
Miss Alan was always thus being charitable against her better
judgement. A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving
them unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there
sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring. She felt she had made
almost too many allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her
toleration.
“All the same, she is a little too—I hardly like to say unwomanly, but
she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived.”
Mr. Beebe smiled as Miss Alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew
she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.
“I don’t know, Miss Honeychurch, if you have noticed that Miss Pole,
the lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. That old Mr.
Emerson, who puts things very strangely—”
Her jaw dropped. She was silent. Mr. Beebe, whose social resources were
endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to Lucy in a
hasty whisper:
“Stomach. He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it—and
he may have meant to be kind. I must say I forgot myself and laughed;
it was so sudden. As Teresa truly said, it was no laughing matter. But
the point is that Miss Lavish was positively _attracted_ by his
mentioning S., and said she liked plain speaking, and meeting different
grades of thought. She thought they were commercial
travellers—‘drummers’ was the word she used—and all through dinner she
tried to prove that England, our great and beloved country, rests on
nothing but commerce. Teresa was very much annoyed, and left the table
before the cheese, saying as she did so: ‘There, Miss Lavish, is one
who can confute you better than I,’ and pointed to that beautiful
picture of Lord Tennyson. Then Miss Lavish said: ‘Tut! The early
Victorians.’ Just imagine! ‘Tut! The early Victorians.’ My sister had
gone, and I felt bound to speak. I said: ‘Miss Lavish, _I_ am an early
Victorian; at least, that is to say, I will hear no breath of censure
against our dear Queen.’ It was horrible speaking. I reminded her how
the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go, and I must
say she was dumbfounded, and made no reply. But, unluckily, Mr. Emerson
overheard this part, and called in his deep voice: ‘Quite so, quite so!
I honour the woman for her Irish visit.’ The woman! I tell things so
badly; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time, all on
account of S. having been mentioned in the first place. But that was
not all. After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said: ‘Miss
Alan, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men.
Come, too.’ Needless to say, I refused such an unsuitable invitation,
and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas,
and said that she had four brothers, all University men, except one who
was in the army, who always made a point of talking to commercial
travellers.”
“Let me finish the story,” said Mr. Beebe, who had returned.
“Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole, myself, everyone, and finally said: ‘I
shall go alone.’ She went. At the end of five minutes she returned
unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.”
“Whatever happened?” cried Lucy.
“No one knows. No one will ever know. Miss Lavish will never dare to
tell, and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling.”
“Mr. Beebe—old Mr. Emerson, is he nice or not nice? I do so want to
know.”
Mr. Beebe laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for
herself.
“No; but it is so difficult. Sometimes he is so silly, and then I do
not mind him. Miss Alan, what do you think? Is he nice?”
The little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. Mr.
Beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:
“I consider that you are bound to class him as nice, Miss Alan, after
that business of the violets.”
“Violets? Oh, dear! Who told you about the violets? How do things get
round? A pension is a bad place for gossips. No, I cannot forget how
they behaved at Mr. Eager’s lecture at Santa Croce. Oh, poor Miss
Honeychurch! It really was too bad. No, I have quite changed. I do
_not_ like the Emersons. They are _not_ nice.”
Mr. Beebe smiled nonchalantly. He had made a gentle effort to introduce
the Emersons into Bertolini society, and the effort had failed. He was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. Miss Lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the Miss Alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her. Miss Bartlett,
smarting under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. The case of Lucy
was different. She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in
Santa Croce, and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and
possibly concerted attempt to annex her, to show her the world from
their own strange standpoint, to interest her in their private sorrows
and joys. This was impertinent; he did not wish their cause to be
championed by a young girl: he would rather it should fail. After all,
he knew nothing about them, and pension joys, pension sorrows, are
flimsy things; whereas Lucy would be his parishioner.
Lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the
Emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. Even their
seats at dinner had been moved.
“But aren’t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?” said
the little lady inquisitively.
“Only once. Charlotte didn’t like it, and said something—quite
politely, of course.”
“Most right of her. They don’t understand our ways. They must find
their level.”
Mr. Beebe rather felt that they had gone under. They had given up their
attempt—if it was one—to conquer society, and now the father was almost
as silent as the son. He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant
day for these folk before they left—some expedition, perhaps, with Lucy
well chaperoned to be nice to them. It was one of Mr. Beebe’s chief
pleasures to provide people with happy memories.
Evening approached while they chatted; the air became brighter; the
colours on the trees and hills were purified, and the Arno lost its
muddy solidity and began to twinkle. There were a few streaks of
bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the
earth, and then the dripping façade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in
the declining sun.
“Too late to go out,” said Miss Alan in a voice of relief. “All the
galleries are shut.”
“I think I shall go out,” said Lucy. “I want to go round the town in
the circular tram—on the platform by the driver.”
Her two companions looked grave. Mr. Beebe, who felt responsible for
her in the absence of Miss Bartlett, ventured to say:
“I wish we could. Unluckily I have letters. If you do want to go out
alone, won’t you be better on your feet?”
“Italians, dear, you know,” said Miss Alan.
“Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through!”
But they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to Mr. Beebe
as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the
street frequented by tourists.
“She oughtn’t really to go at all,” said Mr. Beebe, as they watched her
from the window, “and she knows it. I put it down to too much
Beethoven.”
Chapter IV
Fourth Chapter
Mr. Beebe was right. Lucy never knew her desires so clearly as after
music. She had not really appreciated the clergyman’s wit, nor the
suggestive twitterings of Miss Alan. Conversation was tedious; she
wanted something big, and she believed that it would have come to her
on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. This she might not
attempt. It was unladylike. Why? Why were most big things unladylike?
Charlotte had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were
inferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to
inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves.
Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could
accomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be
first censured, then despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been
written to illustrate this point.
There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady. The dragons have
gone, and so have the knights, but still she lingers in our midst. She
reigned in many an early Victorian castle, and was Queen of much early
Victorian song. It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of
business, sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well.
But alas! the creature grows degenerate. In her heart also there are
springing up strange desires. She too is enamoured of heavy winds, and
vast panoramas, and green expanses of the sea. She has marked the
kingdom of this world, how full it is of wealth, and beauty, and war—a
radiant crust, built around the central fires, spinning towards the
receding heavens. Men, declaring that she inspires them to it, move
joyfully over the surface, having the most delightful meetings with
other men, happy, not because they are masculine, but because they are
alive. Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august
title of the Eternal Woman, and go there as her transitory self.
Lucy does not stand for the medieval lady, who was rather an ideal to
which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious. Nor has she
any system of revolt. Here and there a restriction annoyed her
particularly, and she would transgress it, and perhaps be sorry that
she had done so. This afternoon she was peculiarly restive. She would
really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved. As
she might not go on the electric tram, she went to Alinari’s shop.
There she bought a photograph of Botticelli’s “Birth of Venus.” Venus,
being a pity, spoilt the picture, otherwise so charming, and Miss
Bartlett had persuaded her to do without it. (A pity in art of course
signified the nude.) Giorgione’s “Tempesta,” the “Idolino,” some of the
Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos, were added to it. She felt a
little calmer then, and bought Fra Angelico’s “Coronation,” Giotto’s
“Ascension of St. John,” some Della Robbia babies, and some Guido Reni
Madonnas. For her taste was catholic, and she extended uncritical
approval to every well-known name.
But though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed
still unopened. She was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her
to be conscious of it. “The world,” she thought, “is certainly full of
beautiful things, if only I could come across them.” It was not
surprising that Mrs. Honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that
it always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.
“Nothing ever happens to me,” she reflected, as she entered the Piazza
Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to
her. The great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to
strike it. Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,
half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who
idled together on its marge. The Loggia showed as the triple entrance
of a cave, wherein many a deity, shadowy, but immortal, looking forth
upon the arrivals and departures of mankind. It was the hour of
unreality—the hour, that is, when unfamiliar things are real. An older
person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient
was happening to him, and rest content. Lucy desired more.
She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace, which rose out
of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold. It seemed no
longer a tower, no longer supported by earth, but some unattainable
treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky. Its brightness mesmerized her,
still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and
started towards home.
Then something did happen.
Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt. “Cinque
lire,” they had cried, “cinque lire!” They sparred at each other, and
one of them was hit lightly upon the chest. He frowned; he bent towards
Lucy with a look of interest, as if he had an important message for
her. He opened his lips to deliver it, and a stream of red came out
between them and trickled down his unshaven chin.
That was all. A crowd rose out of the dusk. It hid this extraordinary
man from her, and bore him away to the fountain. Mr. George Emerson
happened to be a few paces away, looking at her across the spot where
the man had been. How very odd! Across something. Even as she caught
sight of him he grew dim; the palace itself grew dim, swayed above her,
fell on to her softly, slowly, noiselessly, and the sky fell with it.
She thought: “Oh, what have I done?”
“Oh, what have I done?” she murmured, and opened her eyes.
George Emerson still looked at her, but not across anything. She had
complained of dullness, and lo! one man was stabbed, and another held
her in his arms.
They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade. He must have
carried her. He rose when she spoke, and began to dust his knees. She
repeated:
“Oh, what have I done?”
“You fainted.”
“I—I am very sorry.”
“How are you now?”
“Perfectly well—absolutely well.” And she began to nod and smile.
“Then let us come home. There’s no point in our stopping.”
He held out his hand to pull her up. She pretended not to see it. The
cries from the fountain—they had never ceased—rang emptily. The whole
world seemed pale and void of its original meaning.
“How very kind you have been! I might have hurt myself falling. But now
I am well. I can go alone, thank you.”
His hand was still extended.
“Oh, my photographs!” she exclaimed suddenly.
“What photographs?”
“I bought some photographs at Alinari’s. I must have dropped them out
there in the square.” She looked at him cautiously. “Would you add to
your kindness by fetching them?”
He added to his kindness. As soon as he had turned his back, Lucy arose
with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the
Arno.
“Miss Honeychurch!”
She stopped with her hand on her heart.
“You sit still; you aren’t fit to go home alone.”
“Yes, I am, thank you so very much.”
“No, you aren’t. You’d go openly if you were.”
“But I had rather—”
“Then I don’t fetch your photographs.”
“I had rather be alone.”
He said imperiously: “The man is dead—the man is probably dead; sit
down till you are rested.” She was bewildered, and obeyed him. “And
don’t move till I come back.”
In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods, such as appear in
dreams. The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day,
and joined itself to earth. How should she talk to Mr. Emerson when he
returned from the shadowy square? Again the thought occurred to her,
“Oh, what have I done?”—the thought that she, as well as the dying man,
had crossed some spiritual boundary.
He returned, and she talked of the murder. Oddly enough, it was an easy
topic. She spoke of the Italian character; she became almost garrulous
over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. Being
strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. She rose
without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,
she walked firmly enough towards the Arno. There a cabman signalled to
them; they refused him.
“And the murderer tried to kiss him, you say—how very odd Italians
are!—and gave himself up to the police! Mr. Beebe was saying that
Italians know everything, but I think they are rather childish. When my
cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday—What was that?”
He had thrown something into the stream.
“What did you throw in?”
“Things I didn’t want,” he said crossly.
“Mr. Emerson!”
“Well?”
“Where are the photographs?”
He was silent.
“I believe it was my photographs that you threw away.”
“I didn’t know what to do with them,” he cried, and his voice was that
of an anxious boy. Her heart warmed towards him for the first time.
“They were covered with blood. There! I’m glad I’ve told you; and all
the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with
them.” He pointed down-stream. “They’ve gone.” The river swirled under
the bridge, “I did mind them so, and one is so foolish, it seemed
better that they should go out to the sea—I don’t know; I may just mean
that they frightened me.” Then the boy verged into a man. “For
something tremendous has happened; I must face it without getting
muddled. It isn’t exactly that a man has died.”
Something warned Lucy that she must stop him.
“It has happened,” he repeated, “and I mean to find out what it is.”
“Mr. Emerson—”
He turned towards her frowning, as if she had disturbed him in some
abstract quest.
“I want to ask you something before we go in.”
They were close to their pension. She stopped and leant her elbows
against the parapet of the embankment. He did likewise. There is at
times a magic in identity of position; it is one of the things that
have suggested to us eternal comradeship. She moved her elbows before
saying:
“I have behaved ridiculously.”
He was following his own thoughts.
“I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life; I cannot think what
came over me.”
“I nearly fainted myself,” he said; but she felt that her attitude
repelled him.
“Well, I owe you a thousand apologies.”
“Oh, all right.”
“And—this is the real point—you know how silly people are
gossiping—ladies especially, I am afraid—you understand what I mean?”
“I’m afraid I don’t.”
“I mean, would you not mention it to any one, my foolish behaviour?”
“Your behaviour? Oh, yes, all right—all right.”
“Thank you so much. And would you—”
She could not carry her request any further. The river was rushing
below them, almost black in the advancing night. He had thrown her
photographs into it, and then he had told her the reason. It struck her
that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man. He would do
her no harm by idle gossip; he was trustworthy, intelligent, and even
kind; he might even have a high opinion of her. But he lacked chivalry;
his thoughts, like his behaviour, would not be modified by awe. It was
useless to say to him, “And would you—” and hope that he would complete
the sentence for himself, averting his eyes from her nakedness like the
knight in that beautiful picture. She had been in his arms, and he
remembered it, just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that
she had bought in Alinari’s shop. It was not exactly that a man had
died; something had happened to the living: they had come to a
situation where character tells, and where childhood enters upon the
branching paths of Youth.
“Well, thank you so much,” she repeated, “How quickly these accidents
do happen, and then one returns to the old life!”
“I don’t.”
Anxiety moved her to question him.
His answer was puzzling: “I shall probably want to live.”
“But why, Mr. Emerson? What do you mean?”
“I shall want to live, I say.”
Leaning her elbows on the parapet, she contemplated the River Arno,
whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears.
Chapter V
Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing
It was a family saying that “you never knew which way Charlotte
Bartlett would turn.” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over
Lucy’s adventure, found the abridged account of it quite adequate, and
paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr. George Emerson. She and
Miss Lavish had had an adventure also. They had been stopped at the
Dazio coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent
and _désœuvré_, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. It
might have been most unpleasant. Fortunately Miss Lavish was a match
for any one.
For good or for evil, Lucy was left to face her problem alone. None of
her friends had seen her, either in the Piazza or, later on, by the
embankment. Mr. Beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at
dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of “Too much
Beethoven.” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,
not that she had encountered it. This solitude oppressed her; she was
accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,
contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking
right or wrong.
At breakfast next morning she took decisive action. There were two
plans between which she had to choose. Mr. Beebe was walking up to the
Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies. Would Miss
Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch join the party? Charlotte declined for
herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. But she
thought it an admirable idea for Lucy, who hated shopping, changing
money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties—all of which Miss
Bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish
alone.
“No, Charlotte!” cried the girl, with real warmth. “It’s very kind of
Mr. Beebe, but I am certainly coming with you. I had much rather.”
“Very well, dear,” said Miss Bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure
that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of Lucy. How
abominably she behaved to Charlotte, now as always! But now she should
alter. All morning she would be really nice to her.
She slipped her arm into her cousin’s, and they started off along the
Lung’ Arno. The river was a lion that morning in strength, voice, and
colour. Miss Bartlett insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at
it. She then made her usual remark, which was “How I do wish Freddy and
your mother could see this, too!”
Lucy fidgeted; it was tiresome of Charlotte to have stopped exactly
where she did.
“Look, Lucia! Oh, you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party. I
feared you would repent you of your choice.”
Serious as the choice had been, Lucy did not repent. Yesterday had been
a muddle—queer and odd, the kind of thing one could not write down
easily on paper—but she had a feeling that Charlotte and her shopping
were preferable to George Emerson and the summit of the Torre del
Gallo. Since she could not unravel the tangle, she must take care not
to re-enter it. She could protest sincerely against Miss Bartlett’s
insinuations.
But though she had avoided the chief actor, the scenery unfortunately
remained. Charlotte, with the complacency of fate, led her from the
river to the Piazza Signoria. She could not have believed that stones,
a Loggia, a fountain, a palace tower, would have such significance. For
a moment she understood the nature of ghosts.
The exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by Miss
Lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. She hailed them
briskly. The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an
idea which she thought would work up into a book.
“Oh, let me congratulate you!” said Miss Bartlett. “After your despair
of yesterday! What a fortunate thing!”
“Aha! Miss Honeychurch, come you here I am in luck. Now, you are to
tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.” Lucy
poked at the ground with her parasol.
“But perhaps you would rather not?”
“I’m sorry—if you could manage without it, I think I would rather not.”
The elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable
that a girl should feel deeply.
“It is I who am sorry,” said Miss Lavish “literary hacks are shameless
creatures. I believe there’s no secret of the human heart into which we
wouldn’t pry.”
She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back, and did a few
calculations in realism. Then she said that she had been in the Piazza
since eight o’clock collecting material. A good deal of it was
unsuitable, but of course one always had to adapt. The two men had
quarrelled over a five-franc note. For the five-franc note she should
substitute a young lady, which would raise the tone of the tragedy, and
at the same time furnish an excellent plot.
“What is the heroine’s name?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Leonora,” said Miss Lavish; her own name was Eleanor.
“I do hope she’s nice.”
That desideratum would not be omitted.
“And what is the plot?”
Love, murder, abduction, revenge, was the plot. But it all came while
the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun.
“I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this,” Miss Lavish
concluded. “It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people. Of
course, this is the barest outline. There will be a deal of local
colouring, descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood, and I shall
also introduce some humorous characters. And let me give you all fair
warning: I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist.”
“Oh, you wicked woman,” cried Miss Bartlett. “I am sure you are
thinking of the Emersons.”
Miss Lavish gave a Machiavellian smile.
“I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen.
It is the neglected Italians who attract me, and whose lives I am going
to paint so far as I can. For I repeat and I insist, and I have always
held most strongly, that a tragedy such as yesterday’s is not the less
tragic because it happened in humble life.”
There was a fitting silence when Miss Lavish had concluded. Then the
cousins wished success to her labours, and walked slowly away across
the square.
“She is my idea of a really clever woman,” said Miss Bartlett. “That
last remark struck me as so particularly true. It should be a most
pathetic novel.”
Lucy assented. At present her great aim was not to get put into it. Her
perceptions this morning were curiously keen, and she believed that
Miss Lavish had her on trial for an _ingenué_.
“She is emancipated, but only in the very best sense of the word,”
continued Miss Bartlett slowly. “None but the superficial would be
shocked at her. We had a long talk yesterday. She believes in justice
and truth and human interest. She told me also that she has a high
opinion of the destiny of woman—Mr. Eager! Why, how nice! What a
pleasant surprise!”
“Ah, not for me,” said the chaplain blandly, “for I have been watching
you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time.”
“We were chatting to Miss Lavish.”
His brow contracted.
“So I saw. Were you indeed? Andate via! sono occupato!” The last remark
was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with
a courteous smile. “I am about to venture a suggestion. Would you and
Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week—a
drive in the hills? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano.
There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an
hour’s ramble on the hillside. The view thence of Florence is most
beautiful—far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole. It is the view
that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures.
That man had a decided feeling for landscape. Decidedly. But who looks
at it to-day? Ah, the world is too much for us.”
Miss Bartlett had not heard of Alessio Baldovinetti, but she knew that
Mr. Eager was no commonplace chaplain. He was a member of the
residential colony who had made Florence their home. He knew the people
who never walked about with Baedekers, who had learnt to take a siesta
after lunch, who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of,
and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them.
Living in delicate seclusion, some in furnished flats, others in
Renaissance villas on Fiesole’s slope, they read, wrote, studied, and
exchanged ideas, thus attaining to that intimate knowledge, or rather
perception, of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their
pockets the coupons of Cook.
Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of.
Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link, and
it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who
seemed worthy, and give them a few hours in the pastures of the
permanent. Tea at a Renaissance villa? Nothing had been said about it
yet. But if it did come to that—how Lucy would enjoy it!
A few days ago and Lucy would have felt the same. But the joys of life
were grouping themselves anew. A drive in the hills with Mr. Eager and
Miss Bartlett—even if culminating in a residential tea-party—was no
longer the greatest of them. She echoed the raptures of Charlotte
somewhat faintly. Only when she heard that Mr. Beebe was also coming
did her thanks become more sincere.
“So we shall be a _partie carrée_,” said the chaplain. “In these days
of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message
of purity. Andate via! andate presto, presto! Ah, the town! Beautiful
as it is, it is the town.”
They assented.
“This very square—so I am told—witnessed yesterday the most sordid of
tragedies. To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there
is something portentous in such desecration—portentous and
humiliating.”
“Humiliating indeed,” said Miss Bartlett. “Miss Honeychurch happened to
be passing through as it happened. She can hardly bear to speak of it.”
She glanced at Lucy proudly.
“And how came we to have you here?” asked the chaplain paternally.
Miss Bartlett’s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. “Do not
blame her, please, Mr. Eager. The fault is mine: I left her
unchaperoned.”
“So you were here alone, Miss Honeychurch?” His voice suggested
sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing
details would not be unacceptable. His dark, handsome face drooped
mournfully towards her to catch her reply.
“Practically.”
“One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home,” said Miss
Bartlett, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver.
“For her also it must have been a terrible experience. I trust that
neither of you was at all—that it was not in your immediate proximity?”
Of the many things Lucy was noticing to-day, not the least remarkable
was this: the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble
after blood. George Emerson had kept the subject strangely pure.
“He died by the fountain, I believe,” was her reply.
“And you and your friend—”
“Were over at the Loggia.”
“That must have saved you much. You have not, of course, seen the
disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press—This man is a public
nuisance; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well, and yet he goes
on worrying me to buy his vulgar views.”
Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with Lucy—in the eternal
league of Italy with youth. He had suddenly extended his book before
Miss Bartlett and Mr. Eager, binding their hands together by a long
glossy ribbon of churches, pictures, and views.
“This is too much!” cried the chaplain, striking petulantly at one of
Fra Angelico’s angels. She tore. A shrill cry rose from the vendor. The
book it seemed, was more valuable than one would have supposed.
“Willingly would I purchase—” began Miss Bartlett.
“Ignore him,” said Mr. Eager sharply, and they all walked rapidly away
from the square.
But an Italian can never be ignored, least of all when he has a
grievance. His mysterious persecution of Mr. Eager became relentless;
the air rang with his threats and lamentations. He appealed to Lucy;
would not she intercede? He was poor—he sheltered a family—the tax on
bread. He waited, he gibbered, he was recompensed, he was dissatisfied,
he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all
thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant.
Shopping was the topic that now ensued. Under the chaplain’s guidance
they selected many hideous presents and mementoes—florid little
picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry; other little
frames, more severe, that stood on little easels, and were carven out
of oak; a blotting book of vellum; a Dante of the same material; cheap
mosaic brooches, which the maids, next Christmas, would never tell from
real; pins, pots, heraldic saucers, brown art-photographs; Eros and
Psyche in alabaster; St. Peter to match—all of which would have cost
less in London.
This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on Lucy. She had
been a little frightened, both by Miss Lavish and by Mr. Eager, she
knew not why. And as they frightened her, she had, strangely enough,
ceased to respect them. She doubted that Miss Lavish was a great
artist. She doubted that Mr. Eager was as full of spirituality and
culture as she had been led to suppose. They were tried by some new
test, and they were found wanting. As for Charlotte—as for Charlotte
she was exactly the same. It might be possible to be nice to her; it
was impossible to love her.
“The son of a labourer; I happen to know it for a fact. A mechanic of
some sort himself when he was young; then he took to writing for the
Socialistic Press. I came across him at Brixton.”
They were talking about the Emersons.
“How wonderfully people rise in these days!” sighed Miss Bartlett,
fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa.
“Generally,” replied Mr. Eager, “one has only sympathy for their
success. The desire for education and for social advance—in these
things there is something not wholly vile. There are some working men
whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence—little as
they would make of it.”
“Is he a journalist now?” Miss Bartlett asked.
“He is not; he made an advantageous marriage.”
He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a
sigh.
“Oh, so he has a wife.”
“Dead, Miss Bartlett, dead. I wonder—yes I wonder how he has the
effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with
me. He was in my London parish long ago. The other day in Santa Croce,
when he was with Miss Honeychurch, I snubbed him. Let him beware that
he does not get more than a snub.”
“What?” cried Lucy, flushing.
“Exposure!” hissed Mr. Eager.
He tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had
interested his audience more than he had intended. Miss Bartlett was
full of very natural curiosity. Lucy, though she wished never to see
the Emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.
“Do you mean,” she asked, “that he is an irreligious man? We know that
already.”
“Lucy, dear—” said Miss Bartlett, gently reproving her cousin’s
penetration.
“I should be astonished if you knew all. The boy—an innocent child at
the time—I will exclude. God knows what his education and his inherited
qualities may have made him.”
“Perhaps,” said Miss Bartlett, “it is something that we had better not
hear.”
“To speak plainly,” said Mr. Eager, “it is. I will say no more.” For
the first time Lucy’s rebellious thoughts swept out in words—for the
first time in her life.
“You have said very little.”
“It was my intention to say very little,” was his frigid reply.
He gazed indignantly at the girl, who met him with equal indignation.
She turned towards him from the shop counter; her breast heaved
quickly. He observed her brow, and the sudden strength of her lips. It
was intolerable that she should disbelieve him.
“Murder, if you want to know,” he cried angrily. “That man murdered his
wife!”
“How?” she retorted.
“To all intents and purposes he murdered her. That day in Santa
Croce—did they say anything against me?”
“Not a word, Mr. Eager—not a single word.”
“Oh, I thought they had been libelling me to you. But I suppose it is
only their personal charms that makes you defend them.”
“I’m not defending them,” said Lucy, losing her courage, and relapsing
into the old chaotic methods. “They’re nothing to me.”
“How could you think she was defending them?” said Miss Bartlett, much
discomfited by the unpleasant scene. The shopman was possibly
listening.
“She will find it difficult. For that man has murdered his wife in the
sight of God.”
The addition of God was striking. But the chaplain was really trying to
qualify a rash remark. A silence followed which might have been
impressive, but was merely awkward. Then Miss Bartlett hastily
purchased the Leaning Tower, and led the way into the street.
“I must be going,” said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.
Miss Bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm
of the approaching drive.
“Drive? Oh, is our drive to come off?”
Lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the
complacency of Mr. Eager was restored.
“Bother the drive!” exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. “It
is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at
all. Why should he invite us in that absurd manner? We might as well
invite him. We are each paying for ourselves.”
Miss Bartlett, who had intended to lament over the Emersons, was
launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.
“If that is so, dear—if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr.
Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe, then I
foresee a sad kettle of fish.”
“How?”
“Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come, too.”
“That will mean another carriage.”
“Far worse. Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor. She knows it herself. The
truth must be told; she is too unconventional for him.”
They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank. Lucy stood by
the central table, heedless of Punch and the Graphic, trying to answer,
or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain. The
well-known world had broken up, and there emerged Florence, a magic
city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things.
Murder, accusations of murder, a lady clinging to one man and being
rude to another—were these the daily incidents of her streets? Was
there more in her frank beauty than met the eye—the power, perhaps, to
evoke passions, good and bad, and to bring them speedily to a
fulfillment?
Happy Charlotte, who, though greatly troubled over things that did not
matter, seemed oblivious to things that did; who could conjecture with
admirable delicacy “where things might lead to,” but apparently lost
sight of the goal as she approached it. Now she was crouching in the
corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag
which hung in chaste concealment round her neck. She had been told that
this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy; it must only be
broached within the walls of the English bank. As she groped she
murmured: “Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager, or Mr.
Eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave
Eleanor out altogether—which they could scarcely do—but in any case we
must be prepared. It is you they really want; I am only asked for
appearances. You shall go with the two gentlemen, and I and Eleanor
will follow behind. A one-horse carriage would do for us. Yet how
difficult it is!”
“It is indeed,” replied the girl, with a gravity that sounded
sympathetic.
“What do you think about it?” asked Miss Bartlett, flushed from the
struggle, and buttoning up her dress.
“I don’t know what I think, nor what I want.”
“Oh, dear, Lucy! I do hope Florence isn’t boring you. Speak the word,
and, as you know, I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow.”
“Thank you, Charlotte,” said Lucy, and pondered over the offer.
There were letters for her at the bureau—one from her brother, full of
athletics and biology; one from her mother, delightful as only her
mother’s letters could be. She had read in it of the crocuses which had
been bought for yellow and were coming up puce, of the new
parlour-maid, who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade, of
the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street, and
breaking the heart of Sir Harry Otway. She recalled the free, pleasant
life of her home, where she was allowed to do everything, and where
nothing ever happened to her. The road up through the pine-woods, the
clean drawing-room, the view over the Sussex Weald—all hung before her
bright and distinct, but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to
which, after much experience, a traveller returns.
“And the news?” asked Miss Bartlett.
“Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome,” said Lucy, giving the news
that interested her least. “Do you know the Vyses?”
“Oh, not that way back. We can never have too much of the dear Piazza
Signoria.”
“They’re nice people, the Vyses. So clever—my idea of what’s really
clever. Don’t you long to be in Rome?”
“I die for it!”
The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant. It has no grass, no
flowers, no frescoes, no glittering walls of marble or comforting
patches of ruddy brick. By an odd chance—unless we believe in a
presiding genius of places—the statues that relieve its severity
suggest, not the innocence of childhood, nor the glorious bewilderment
of youth, but the conscious achievements of maturity. Perseus and
Judith, Hercules and Thusnelda, they have done or suffered something,
and though they are immortal, immortality has come to them after
experience, not before. Here, not only in the solitude of Nature, might
a hero meet a goddess, or a heroine a god.
“Charlotte!” cried the girl suddenly. “Here’s an idea. What if we
popped off to Rome to-morrow—straight to the Vyses’ hotel? For I do
know what I want. I’m sick of Florence. No, you said you’d go to the
ends of the earth! Do! Do!”
Miss Bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:
“Oh, you droll person! Pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?”
They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.
Chapter VI
The Reverend Arthur Beebe, the Reverend Cuthbert Eager, Mr. Emerson,
Mr. George Emerson, Miss Eleanor Lavish, Miss Charlotte Bartlett, and
Miss Lucy Honeychurch Drive Out in Carriages to See a View; Italians
Drive Them.
It was Phaethon who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his master’s horses up
the stony hill. Mr. Beebe recognized him at once. Neither the Ages of
Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him; he was Phaethon in Tuscany
driving a cab. And it was Persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on
the way, saying that she was his sister—Persephone, tall and slender
and pale, returning with the Spring to her mother’s cottage, and still
shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light. To her Mr. Eager
objected, saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge, and one must
guard against imposition. But the ladies interceded, and when it had
been made clear that it was a very great favour, the goddess was
allowed to mount beside the god.
Phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling
himself to drive with his arm round her waist. She did not mind. Mr.
Eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the
indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with Lucy. The
other two occupants of the carriage were old Mr. Emerson and Miss
Lavish. For a dreadful thing had happened: Mr. Beebe, without
consulting Mr. Eager, had doubled the size of the party. And though
Miss Bartlett and Miss Lavish had planned all the morning how the
people were to sit, at the critical moment when the carriages came
round they lost their heads, and Miss Lavish got in with Lucy, while
Miss Bartlett, with George Emerson and Mr. Beebe, followed on behind.
It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his _partie carrée_ thus
transformed. Tea at a Renaissance villa, if he had ever meditated it,
was now impossible. Lucy and Miss Bartlett had a certain style about
them, and Mr. Beebe, though unreliable, was a man of parts. But a
shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the
sight of God—they should enter no villa at his introduction.
Lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these
explosive ingredients, attentive to Mr. Eager, repressive towards Miss
Lavish, watchful of old Mr. Emerson, hitherto fortunately asleep,
thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring. She looked
on the expedition as the work of Fate. But for it she would have
avoided George Emerson successfully. In an open manner he had shown
that he wished to continue their intimacy. She had refused, not because
she disliked him, but because she did not know what had happened, and
suspected that he did know. And this frightened her.
For the real event—whatever it was—had taken place, not in the Loggia,
but by the river. To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable.
But to discuss it afterwards, to pass from discussion into silence, and
through silence into sympathy, that is an error, not of a startled
emotion, but of the whole fabric. There was really something
blameworthy (she thought) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy
stream, in the common impulse which had turned them to the house
without the passing of a look or word. This sense of wickedness had
been slight at first. She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del
Gallo. But each time that she avoided George it became more imperative
that she should avoid him again. And now celestial irony, working
through her cousin and two clergymen, did not suffer her to leave
Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills.
Meanwhile Mr. Eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was
over.
“So, Miss Honeychurch, you are travelling? As a student of art?”
“Oh, dear me, no—oh, no!”
“Perhaps as a student of human nature,” interposed Miss Lavish, “like
myself?”
“Oh, no. I am here as a tourist.”
“Oh, indeed,” said Mr. Eager. “Are you indeed? If you will not think me
rude, we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little—handed
about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence, from Florence to
Rome, living herded together in pensions or hotels, quite unconscious
of anything that is outside Baedeker, their one anxiety to get ‘done’
or ‘through’ and go on somewhere else. The result is, they mix up
towns, rivers, palaces in one inextricable whirl. You know the American
girl in Punch who says: ‘Say, poppa, what did we see at Rome?’ And the
father replies: ‘Why, guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller
dog.’ There’s travelling for you. Ha! ha! ha!”
“I quite agree,” said Miss Lavish, who had several times tried to
interrupt his mordant wit. “The narrowness and superficiality of the
Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.”
“Quite so. Now, the English colony at Florence, Miss Honeychurch—and it
is of considerable size, though, of course, not all equally—a few are
here for trade, for example. But the greater part are students. Lady
Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico. I mention her
name because we are passing her villa on the left. No, you can only see
it if you stand—no, do not stand; you will fall. She is very proud of
that thick hedge. Inside, perfect seclusion. One might have gone back
six hundred years. Some critics believe that her garden was the scene
of The Decameron, which lends it an additional interest, does it not?”
“It does indeed!” cried Miss Lavish. “Tell me, where do they place the
scene of that wonderful seventh day?”
But Mr. Eager proceeded to tell Miss Honeychurch that on the right
lived Mr. Someone Something, an American of the best type—so rare!—and
that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill. “Doubtless you know
her monographs in the series of ‘Mediæval Byways’? He is working at
Gemistus Pletho. Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I
hear, over the wall, the electric tram squealing up the new road with
its loads of hot, dusty, unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘do’
Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there, and
I think—think—I think how little they think what lies so near them.”
During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each
other disgracefully. Lucy had a spasm of envy. Granted that they wished
to misbehave, it was pleasant for them to be able to do so. They were
probably the only people enjoying the expedition. The carriage swept
with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the
Settignano road.
“Piano! piano!” said Mr. Eager, elegantly waving his hand over his
head.
“Va bene, signore, va bene, va bene,” crooned the driver, and whipped
his horses up again.
Now Mr. Eager and Miss Lavish began to talk against each other on the
subject of Alessio Baldovinetti. Was he a cause of the Renaissance, or
was he one of its manifestations? The other carriage was left behind.
As the pace increased to a gallop the large, slumbering form of Mr.
Emerson was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a
machine.
“Piano! piano!” said he, with a martyred look at Lucy.
An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat. Phaethon, who for
some time had been endeavouring to kiss Persephone, had just succeeded.
A little scene ensued, which, as Miss Bartlett said afterwards, was
most unpleasant. The horses were stopped, the lovers were ordered to
disentangle themselves, the boy was to lose his _pourboire_, the girl
was immediately to get down.
“She is my sister,” said he, turning round on them with piteous eyes.
Mr. Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar.
Phaethon hung down his head, not at the matter of the accusation, but
at its manner. At this point Mr. Emerson, whom the shock of stopping
had awoke, declared that the lovers must on no account be separated,
and patted them on the back to signify his approval. And Miss Lavish,
though unwilling to ally him, felt bound to support the cause of
Bohemianism.
“Most certainly I would let them be,” she cried. “But I dare say I
shall receive scant support. I have always flown in the face of the
conventions all my life. This is what _I_ call an adventure.”
“We must not submit,” said Mr. Eager. “I knew he was trying it on. He
is treating us as if we were a party of Cook’s tourists.”
“Surely no!” said Miss Lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.
The other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible Mr. Beebe called
out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave
themselves properly.
“Leave them alone,” Mr. Emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood
in no awe. “Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off
the box when it happens to sit there? To be driven by lovers—A king
might envy us, and if we part them it’s more like sacrilege than
anything I know.”
Here the voice of Miss Bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun
to collect.
Mr. Eager, who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a
resolute will, was determined to make himself heard. He addressed the
driver again. Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream,
with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony. In
Mr. Eager’s mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling
fountain which played ever higher and higher, and quicker and quicker,
and more and more shrilly, till abruptly it was turned off with a
click.
“Signorina!” said the man to Lucy, when the display had ceased. Why
should he appeal to Lucy?
“Signorina!” echoed Persephone in her glorious contralto. She pointed
at the other carriage. Why?
For a moment the two girls looked at each other. Then Persephone got
down from the box.
“Victory at last!” said Mr. Eager, smiting his hands together as the
carriages started again.
“It is not victory,” said Mr. Emerson. “It is defeat. You have parted
two people who were happy.”
Mr. Eager shut his eyes. He was obliged to sit next to Mr. Emerson, but
he would not speak to him. The old man was refreshed by sleep, and took
up the matter warmly. He commanded Lucy to agree with him; he shouted
for support to his son.
“We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money. He has
bargained to drive us, and he is doing it. We have no rights over his
soul.”
Miss Lavish frowned. It is hard when a person you have classed as
typically British speaks out of his character.
“He was not driving us well,” she said. “He jolted us.”
“That I deny. It was as restful as sleeping. Aha! he is jolting us now.
Can you wonder? He would like to throw us out, and most certainly he is
justified. And if I were superstitious I’d be frightened of the girl,
too. It doesn’t do to injure young people. Have you ever heard of
Lorenzo de Medici?”
Miss Lavish bristled.
“Most certainly I have. Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico, or to
Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of
his diminutive stature?”
“The Lord knows. Possibly he does know, for I refer to Lorenzo the
poet. He wrote a line—so I heard yesterday—which runs like this: ‘Don’t
go fighting against the Spring.’”
Mr. Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition.
“Non fate guerra al Maggio,” he murmured. “‘War not with the May’ would
render a correct meaning.”
“The point is, we have warred with it. Look.” He pointed to the Val
d’Arno, which was visible far below them, through the budding trees.
“Fifty miles of Spring, and we’ve come up to admire them. Do you
suppose there’s any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in
man? But there we go, praising the one and condemning the other as
improper, ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both.”
No one encouraged him to talk. Presently Mr. Eager gave a signal for
the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the
hill. A hollow like a great amphitheatre, full of terraced steps and
misty olives, now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole, and the
road, still following its curve, was about to sweep on to a promontory
which stood out in the plain. It was this promontory, uncultivated,
wet, covered with bushes and occasional trees, which had caught the
fancy of Alessio Baldovinetti nearly five hundred years before. He had
ascended it, that diligent and rather obscure master, possibly with an
eye to business, possibly for the joy of ascending. Standing there, he
had seen that view of the Val d’Arno and distant Florence, which he
afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work. But where
exactly had he stood? That was the question which Mr. Eager hoped to
solve now. And Miss Lavish, whose nature was attracted by anything
problematical, had become equally enthusiastic.
But it is not easy to carry the pictures of Alessio Baldovinetti in
your head, even if you have remembered to look at them before starting.
And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest.
The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass, their anxiety to
keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different
directions. Finally they split into groups. Lucy clung to Miss Bartlett
and Miss Lavish; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with
the drivers; while the two clergymen, who were expected to have topics
in common, were left to each other.
The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. In the audible whisper
that was now so familiar to Lucy they began to discuss, not Alessio
Baldovinetti, but the drive. Miss Bartlett had asked Mr. George Emerson
what his profession was, and he had answered “the railway.” She was
very sorry that she had asked him. She had no idea that it would be
such a dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. Mr. Beebe had
turned the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man
was not very much hurt at her asking him.
“The railway!” gasped Miss Lavish. “Oh, but I shall die! Of course it
was the railway!” She could not control her mirth. “He is the image of
a porter—on, on the South-Eastern.”
“Eleanor, be quiet,” plucking at her vivacious companion. “Hush!
They’ll hear—the Emersons—”
“I can’t stop. Let me go my wicked way. A porter—”
“Eleanor!”
“I’m sure it’s all right,” put in Lucy. “The Emersons won’t hear, and
they wouldn’t mind if they did.”
Miss Lavish did not seem pleased at this.
“Miss Honeychurch listening!” she said rather crossly. “Pouf! Wouf! You
naughty girl! Go away!”
“Oh, Lucy, you ought to be with Mr. Eager, I’m sure.”
“I can’t find them now, and I don’t want to either.”
“Mr. Eager will be offended. It is your party.”
“Please, I’d rather stop here with you.”
“No, I agree,” said Miss Lavish. “It’s like a school feast; the boys
have got separated from the girls. Miss Lucy, you are to go. We wish to
converse on high topics unsuited for your ear.”
The girl was stubborn. As her time at Florence drew to its close she
was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent. Such a one
was Miss Lavish, and such for the moment was Charlotte. She wished she
had not called attention to herself; they were both annoyed at her
remark and seemed determined to get rid of her.
“How tired one gets,” said Miss Bartlett. “Oh, I do wish Freddy and
your mother could be here.”
Unselfishness with Miss Bartlett had entirely usurped the functions of
enthusiasm. Lucy did not look at the view either. She would not enjoy
anything till she was safe at Rome.
“Then sit you down,” said Miss Lavish. “Observe my foresight.”
With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that
protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps.
She sat on one; who was to sit on the other?
“Lucy; without a moment’s doubt, Lucy. The ground will do for me.
Really I have not had rheumatism for years. If I do feel it coming on I
shall stand. Imagine your mother’s feelings if I let you sit in the wet
in your white linen.” She sat down heavily where the ground looked
particularly moist. “Here we are, all settled delightfully. Even if my
dress is thinner it will not show so much, being brown. Sit down, dear;
you are too unselfish; you don’t assert yourself enough.” She cleared
her throat. “Now don’t be alarmed; this isn’t a cold. It’s the tiniest
cough, and I have had it three days. It’s nothing to do with sitting
here at all.”
There was only one way of treating the situation. At the end of five
minutes Lucy departed in search of Mr. Beebe and Mr. Eager, vanquished
by the mackintosh square.
She addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the
carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. The miscreant, a bony
young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the
courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative.
“Dove?” said Lucy, after much anxious thought.
His face lit up. Of course he knew where. Not so far either. His arm
swept three-fourths of the horizon. He should just think he did know
where. He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them
towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.
More seemed necessary. What was the Italian for “clergyman”?
“Dove buoni uomini?” said she at last.
Good? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! He showed her his
cigar.
“Uno—piu—piccolo,” was her next remark, implying “Has the cigar been
given to you by Mr. Beebe, the smaller of the two good men?”
She was correct as usual. He tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to
make it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded
his hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of
a minute was ready to conduct her. Italians are born knowing the way.
It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but
as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces
as well as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of
people is a gift from God.
He only stopped once, to pick her some great blue violets. She thanked
him with real pleasure. In the company of this common man the world was
beautiful and direct. For the first time she felt the influence of
Spring. His arm swept the horizon gracefully; violets, like other
things, existed in great profusion there; “would she like to see them?”
“Ma buoni uomini.”
He bowed. Certainly. Good men first, violets afterwards. They proceeded
briskly through the undergrowth, which became thicker and thicker. They
were nearing the edge of the promontory, and the view was stealing
round them, but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into
countless pieces. He was occupied in his cigar, and in holding back the
pliant boughs. She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness. Not a
step, not a twig, was unimportant to her.
“What is that?”
There was a voice in the wood, in the distance behind them. The voice
of Mr. Eager? He shrugged his shoulders. An Italian’s ignorance is
sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge. She could not make him
understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen. The view was
forming at last; she could discern the river, the golden plain, other
hills.
“Eccolo!” he exclaimed.
At the same moment the ground gave way, and with a cry she fell out of
the wood. Light and beauty enveloped her. She had fallen on to a little
open terrace, which was covered with violets from end to end.
“Courage!” cried her companion, now standing some six feet above.
“Courage and love.”
She did not answer. From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view,
and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts, irrigating
the hillside with blue, eddying round the tree stems collecting into
pools in the hollows, covering the grass with spots of azure foam. But
never again were they in such profusion; this terrace was the
well-head, the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the
earth.
Standing at its brink, like a swimmer who prepares, was the good man.
But he was not the good man that she had expected, and he was alone.
George had turned at the sound of her arrival. For a moment he
contemplated her, as one who had fallen out of heaven. He saw radiant
joy in her face, he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue
waves. The bushes above them closed. He stepped quickly forward and
kissed her.
Before she could speak, almost before she could feel, a voice called,
“Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!” The silence of life had been broken by Miss
Bartlett who stood brown against the view.
Chapter VII
They Return
Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the
afternoon. What it was and exactly how the players had sided, Lucy was
slow to discover. Mr. Eager had met them with a questioning eye.
Charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. Mr. Emerson, seeking
his son, was told whereabouts to find him. Mr. Beebe, who wore the
heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the
return home. There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. Pan
had been amongst them—not the great god Pan, who has been buried these
two thousand years, but the little god Pan, who presides over social
contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. Mr. Beebe had lost everyone, and
had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a
pleasant surprise. Miss Lavish had lost Miss Bartlett. Lucy had lost
Mr. Eager. Mr. Emerson had lost George. Miss Bartlett had lost a
mackintosh square. Phaethon had lost the game.
That last fact was undeniable. He climbed on to the box shivering, with
his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. “Let us
go immediately,” he told them. “The signorino will walk.”
“All the way? He will be hours,” said Mr. Beebe.
“Apparently. I told him it was unwise.” He would look no one in the
face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. He alone had
played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others had
used scraps of their intelligence. He alone had divined what things
were, and what he wished them to be. He alone had interpreted the
message that Lucy had received five days before from the lips of a
dying man. Persephone, who spends half her life in the grave—she could
interpret it also. Not so these English. They gain knowledge slowly,
and perhaps too late.
The thoughts of a cab-driver, however just, seldom affect the lives of
his employers. He was the most competent of Miss Bartlett’s opponents,
but infinitely the least dangerous. Once back in the town, he and his
insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more. Of
course, it was most unpleasant; she had seen his black head in the
bushes; he might make a tavern story out of it. But after all, what
have we to do with taverns? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room. It
was of drawing-room people that Miss Bartlett thought as she journeyed
downwards towards the fading sun. Lucy sat beside her; Mr. Eager sat
opposite, trying to catch her eye; he was vaguely suspicious. They
spoke of Alessio Baldovinetti.
Rain and darkness came on together. The two ladies huddled together
under an inadequate parasol. There was a lightning flash, and Miss
Lavish who was nervous, screamed from the carriage in front. At the
next flash, Lucy screamed also. Mr. Eager addressed her professionally:
“Courage, Miss Honeychurch, courage and faith. If I might say so, there
is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements. Are we
seriously to suppose that all these clouds, all this immense electrical
display, is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me?”
“No—of course—”
“Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being
struck are enormous. The steel knives, the only articles which might
attract the current, are in the other carriage. And, in any case, we
are infinitely safer than if we were walking. Courage—courage and
faith.”
Under the rug, Lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousin’s hand. At
times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not
what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it
afterwards. Miss Bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,
gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross
examination.
She renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into Florence.
“Mr. Eager!” called Mr. Beebe. “We want your assistance. Will you
interpret for us?”
“George!” cried Mr. Emerson. “Ask your driver which way George went.
The boy may lose his way. He may be killed.”
“Go, Mr. Eager,” said Miss Bartlett, “don’t ask our driver; our driver
is no help. Go and support poor Mr. Beebe—, he is nearly demented.”
“He may be killed!” cried the old man. “He may be killed!”
“Typical behaviour,” said the chaplain, as he quitted the carriage. “In
the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down.”
“What does he know?” whispered Lucy as soon as they were alone.
“Charlotte, how much does Mr. Eager know?”
“Nothing, dearest; he knows nothing. But—” she pointed at the
driver—“_he_ knows everything. Dearest, had we better? Shall I?” She
took out her purse. “It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class
people. He saw it all.” Tapping Phaethon’s back with her guide-book,
she said, “Silenzio!” and offered him a franc.
“Va bene,” he replied, and accepted it. As well this ending to his day
as any. But Lucy, a mortal maid, was disappointed in him.
There was an explosion up the road. The storm had struck the overhead
wire of the tramline, and one of the great supports had fallen. If they
had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt. They chose to regard
it as a miraculous preservation, and the floods of love and sincerity,
which fructify every hour of life, burst forth in tumult. They
descended from the carriages; they embraced each other. It was as
joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them. For a
moment they realized vast possibilities of good.
The older people recovered quickly. In the very height of their emotion
they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike. Miss Lavish calculated that,
even if they had continued, they would not have been caught in the
accident. Mr. Eager mumbled a temperate prayer. But the drivers,
through miles of dark squalid road, poured out their souls to the
dryads and the saints, and Lucy poured out hers to her cousin.
“Charlotte, dear Charlotte, kiss me. Kiss me again. Only you can
understand me. You warned me to be careful. And I—I thought I was
developing.”
“Do not cry, dearest. Take your time.”
“I have been obstinate and silly—worse than you know, far worse. Once
by the river—Oh, but he isn’t killed—he wouldn’t be killed, would he?”
The thought disturbed her repentance. As a matter of fact, the storm
was worst along the road; but she had been near danger, and so she
thought it must be near to everyone.
“I trust not. One would always pray against that.”
“He is really—I think he was taken by surprise, just as I was before.
But this time I’m not to blame; I want you to believe that. I simply
slipped into those violets. No, I want to be really truthful. I am a
little to blame. I had silly thoughts. The sky, you know, was gold, and
the ground all blue, and for a moment he looked like someone in a
book.”
“In a book?”
“Heroes—gods—the nonsense of schoolgirls.”
“And then?”
“But, Charlotte, you know what happened then.”
Miss Bartlett was silent. Indeed, she had little more to learn. With a
certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to
her. All the way back Lucy’s body was shaken by deep sighs, which
nothing could repress.
“I want to be truthful,” she whispered. “It is so hard to be absolutely
truthful.”
“Don’t be troubled, dearest. Wait till you are calmer. We will talk it
over before bed-time in my room.”
So they re-entered the city with hands clasped. It was a shock to the
girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. The storm had ceased,
and Mr. Emerson was easier about his son. Mr. Beebe had regained good
humour, and Mr. Eager was already snubbing Miss Lavish. Charlotte alone
she was sure of—Charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and
love.
The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long
evening. She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she
should describe it. All her sensations, her spasms of courage, her
moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be
carefully laid before her cousin. And together in divine confidence
they would disentangle and interpret them all.
“At last,” thought she, “I shall understand myself. I shan’t again be
troubled by things that come out of nothing, and mean I don’t know
what.”
Miss Alan asked her to play. She refused vehemently. Music seemed to
her the employment of a child. She sat close to her cousin, who, with
commendable patience, was listening to a long story about lost luggage.
When it was over she capped it by a story of her own. Lucy became
rather hysterical with the delay. In vain she tried to check, or at all
events to accelerate, the tale. It was not till a late hour that Miss
Bartlett had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of
gentle reproach:
“Well, dear, I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire. Come into my
room, and I will give a good brush to your hair.”
With some solemnity the door was shut, and a cane chair placed for the
girl. Then Miss Bartlett said “So what is to be done?”
She was unprepared for the question. It had not occurred to her that
she would have to do anything. A detailed exhibition of her emotions
was all that she had counted upon.
“What is to be done? A point, dearest, which you alone can settle.”
The rain was streaming down the black windows, and the great room felt
damp and chilly, One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers
close to Miss Bartlett’s toque, which cast monstrous and fantastic
shadows on the bolted door. A tram roared by in the dark, and Lucy felt
unaccountably sad, though she had long since dried her eyes. She lifted
them to the ceiling, where the griffins and bassoons were colourless
and vague, the very ghosts of joy.
“It has been raining for nearly four hours,” she said at last.
Miss Bartlett ignored the remark.
“How do you propose to silence him?”
“The driver?”
“My dear girl, no; Mr. George Emerson.”
Lucy began to pace up and down the room.
“I don’t understand,” she said at last.
She understood very well, but she no longer wished to be absolutely
truthful.
“How are you going to stop him talking about it?”
“I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do.”
“I, too, intend to judge him charitably. But unfortunately I have met
the type before. They seldom keep their exploits to themselves.”
“Exploits?” cried Lucy, wincing under the horrible plural.
“My poor dear, did you suppose that this was his first? Come here and
listen to me. I am only gathering it from his own remarks. Do you
remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking
one person is an extra reason for liking another?”
“Yes,” said Lucy, whom at the time the argument had pleased.
“Well, I am no prude. There is no need to call him a wicked young man,
but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined. Let us put it down to his
deplorable antecedents and education, if you wish. But we are no
farther on with our question. What do you propose to do?”
An idea rushed across Lucy’s brain, which, had she thought of it sooner
and made it part of her, might have proved victorious.
“I propose to speak to him,” said she.
Miss Bartlett uttered a cry of genuine alarm.
“You see, Charlotte, your kindness—I shall never forget it. But—as you
said—it is my affair. Mine and his.”
“And you are going to _implore_ him, to _beg_ him to keep silence?”
“Certainly not. There would be no difficulty. Whatever you ask him he
answers, yes or no; then it is over. I have been frightened of him. But
now I am not one little bit.”
“But we fear him for you, dear. You are so young and inexperienced, you
have lived among such nice people, that you cannot realize what men can
be—how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her
sex does not protect and rally round. This afternoon, for example, if I
had not arrived, what would have happened?”
“I can’t think,” said Lucy gravely.
Something in her voice made Miss Bartlett repeat her question, intoning
it more vigorously.
“What would have happened if I hadn’t arrived?”
“I can’t think,” said Lucy again.
“When he insulted you, how would you have replied?”
“I hadn’t time to think. You came.”
“Yes, but won’t you tell me now what you would have done?”
“I should have—” She checked herself, and broke the sentence off. She
went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness.
She could not think what she would have done.
“Come away from the window, dear,” said Miss Bartlett. “You will be
seen from the road.”
Lucy obeyed. She was in her cousin’s power. She could not modulate out
the key of self-abasement in which she had started. Neither of them
referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to George and
settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.
Miss Bartlett became plaintive.
“Oh, for a real man! We are only two women, you and I. Mr. Beebe is
hopeless. There is Mr. Eager, but you do not trust him. Oh, for your
brother! He is young, but I know that his sister’s insult would rouse
in him a very lion. Thank God, chivalry is not yet dead. There are
still left some men who can reverence woman.”
As she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and
ranged them upon the pin cushion. Then she blew into her gloves and
said:
“It will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.”
“What train?”
“The train to Rome.” She looked at her gloves critically.
The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given.
“When does the train to Rome go?”
“At eight.”
“Signora Bertolini would be upset.”
“We must face that,” said Miss Bartlett, not liking to say that she had
given notice already.
“She will make us pay for a whole week’s pension.”
“I expect she will. However, we shall be much more comfortable at the
Vyses’ hotel. Isn’t afternoon tea given there for nothing?”
“Yes, but they pay extra for wine.” After this remark she remained
motionless and silent. To her tired eyes Charlotte throbbed and swelled
like a ghostly figure in a dream.
They began to sort their clothes for packing, for there was no time to
lose, if they were to catch the train to Rome. Lucy, when admonished,
began to move to and fro between the rooms, more conscious of the
discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill. Charlotte,
who was practical without ability, knelt by the side of an empty trunk,
vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and
size. She gave two or three sighs, for the stooping posture hurt her
back, and, for all her diplomacy, she felt that she was growing old.
The girl heard her as she entered the room, and was seized with one of
those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause.
She only felt that the candle would burn better, the packing go easier,
the world be happier, if she could give and receive some human love.
The impulse had come before to-day, but never so strongly. She knelt
down by her cousin’s side and took her in her arms.
Miss Bartlett returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth. But she
was not a stupid woman, and she knew perfectly well that Lucy did not
love her, but needed her to love. For it was in ominous tones that she
said, after a long pause:
“Dearest Lucy, how will you ever forgive me?”
Lucy was on her guard at once, knowing by bitter experience what
forgiving Miss Bartlett meant. Her emotion relaxed, she modified her
embrace a little, and she said:
“Charlotte dear, what do you mean? As if I have anything to forgive!”
“You have a great deal, and I have a very great deal to forgive myself,
too. I know well how much I vex you at every turn.”
“But no—”
Miss Bartlett assumed her favourite role, that of the prematurely aged
martyr.
“Ah, but yes! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had
hoped. I might have known it would not do. You want someone younger and
stronger and more in sympathy with you. I am too uninteresting and
old-fashioned—only fit to pack and unpack your things.”
“Please—”
“My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste, and
were often able to leave me at home. I had my own poor ideas of what a
lady ought to do, but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than
was necessary. You had your own way about these rooms, at all events.”
“You mustn’t say these things,” said Lucy softly.
She still clung to the hope that she and Charlotte loved each other,
heart and soul. They continued to pack in silence.
“I have been a failure,” said Miss Bartlett, as she struggled with the
straps of Lucy’s trunk instead of strapping her own. “Failed to make
you happy; failed in my duty to your mother. She has been so generous
to me; I shall never face her again after this disaster.”
“But mother will understand. It is not your fault, this trouble, and it
isn’t a disaster either.”
“It is my fault, it is a disaster. She will never forgive me, and
rightly. For instance, what right had I to make friends with Miss
Lavish?”
“Every right.”
“When I was here for your sake? If I have vexed you it is equally true
that I have neglected you. Your mother will see this as clearly as I
do, when you tell her.”
Lucy, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation, said:
“Why need mother hear of it?”
“But you tell her everything?”
“I suppose I do generally.”
“I dare not break your confidence. There is something sacred in it.
Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her.”
The girl would not be degraded to this.
“Naturally I should have told her. But in case she should blame you in
any way, I promise I will not, I am very willing not to. I will never
speak of it either to her or to any one.”
Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close. Miss
Bartlett pecked her smartly on both cheeks, wished her good-night, and
sent her to her own room.
For a moment the original trouble was in the background. George would
seem to have behaved like a cad throughout; perhaps that was the view
which one would take eventually. At present she neither acquitted nor
condemned him; she did not pass judgement. At the moment when she was
about to judge him her cousin’s voice had intervened, and, ever since,
it was Miss Bartlett who had dominated; Miss Bartlett who, even now,
could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall; Miss
Bartlett, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor
inconsistent. She had worked like a great artist; for a time—indeed,
for years—she had been meaningless, but at the end there was presented
to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless, loveless world in
which the young rush to destruction until they learn better—a
shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil, but
which do not seem to bring good, if we may judge from those who have
used them most.
Lucy was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has
yet discovered: diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity,
of her craving for sympathy and love. Such a wrong is not easily
forgotten. Never again did she expose herself without due consideration
and precaution against rebuff. And such a wrong may react disastrously
upon the soul.
The door-bell rang, and she started to the shutters. Before she reached
them she hesitated, turned, and blew out the candle. Thus it was that,
though she saw someone standing in the wet below, he, though he looked
up, did not see her.
To reach his room he had to go by hers. She was still dressed. It
struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she
would be gone before he was up, and that their extraordinary
intercourse was over.
Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved. At the
critical moment Miss Bartlett opened her own door, and her voice said:
“I wish one word with you in the drawing-room, Mr. Emerson, please.”
Soon their footsteps returned, and Miss Bartlett said: “Good-night, Mr.
Emerson.”
His heavy, tired breathing was the only reply; the chaperon had done
her work.
Lucy cried aloud: “It isn’t true. It can’t all be true. I want not to
be muddled. I want to grow older quickly.”
Miss Bartlett tapped on the wall.
“Go to bed at once, dear. You need all the rest you can get.”
In the morning they left for Rome.
PART TWO
Chapter VIII
Medieval
The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet, for
the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun. They
were heavy curtains, reaching almost to the ground, and the light that
filtered through them was subdued and varied. A poet—none was
present—might have quoted, “Life like a dome of many coloured glass,”
or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates, lowered against
the intolerable tides of heaven. Without was poured a sea of radiance;
within, the glory, though visible, was tempered to the capacities of
man.
Two pleasant people sat in the room. One—a boy of nineteen—was studying
a small manual of anatomy, and peering occasionally at a bone which lay
upon the piano. From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed
and groaned, for the day was hot and the print small, and the human
frame fearfully made; and his mother, who was writing a letter, did
continually read out to him what she had written. And continually did
she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light
fell across the carpet, and make the remark that they were still there.
“Where aren’t they?” said the boy, who was Freddy, Lucy’s brother. “I
tell you I’m getting fairly sick.”
“For goodness’ sake go out of my drawing-room, then?” cried Mrs.
Honeychurch, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it
literally.
Freddy did not move or reply.
“I think things are coming to a head,” she observed, rather wanting her
son’s opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue
supplication.
“Time they did.”
“I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more.”
“It’s his third go, isn’t it?”
“Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind.”
“I didn’t mean to be unkind.” Then he added: “But I do think Lucy might
have got this off her chest in Italy. I don’t know how girls manage
things, but she can’t have said ‘No’ properly before, or she wouldn’t
have to say it again now. Over the whole thing—I can’t explain—I do
feel so uncomfortable.”
“Do you indeed, dear? How interesting!”
“I feel—never mind.”
He returned to his work.
“Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse. I said: ‘Dear Mrs.
Vyse.’”
“Yes, mother, you told me. A jolly good letter.”
“I said: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse, Cecil has just asked my permission about it,
and I should be delighted, if Lucy wishes it. But—’” She stopped
reading, “I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all. He
has always gone in for unconventionality, and parents nowhere, and so
forth. When it comes to the point, he can’t get on without me.”
“Nor me.”
“You?”
Freddy nodded.
“What do you mean?”
“He asked me for my permission also.”
She exclaimed: “How very odd of him!”
“Why so?” asked the son and heir. “Why shouldn’t my permission be
asked?”
“What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything? What ever did you
say?”
“I said to Cecil, ‘Take her or leave her; it’s no business of mine!’”
“What a helpful answer!” But her own answer, though more normal in its
wording, had been to the same effect.
“The bother is this,” began Freddy.
Then he took up his work again, too shy to say what the bother was.
Mrs. Honeychurch went back to the window.
“Freddy, you must come. There they still are!”
“I don’t see you ought to go peeping like that.”
“Peeping like that! Can’t I look out of my own window?”
But she returned to the writing-table, observing, as she passed her
son, “Still page 322?” Freddy snorted, and turned over two leaves. For
a brief space they were silent. Close by, beyond the curtains, the
gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased.
“The bother is this: I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully.”
He gave a nervous gulp. “Not content with ‘permission’, which I did
give—that is to say, I said, ‘I don’t mind’—well, not content with
that, he wanted to know whether I wasn’t off my head with joy. He
practically put it like this: Wasn’t it a splendid thing for Lucy and
for Windy Corner generally if he married her? And he would have an
answer—he said it would strengthen his hand.”
“I hope you gave a careful answer, dear.”
“I answered ‘No’” said the boy, grinding his teeth. “There! Fly into a
stew! I can’t help it—had to say it. I had to say no. He ought never to
have asked me.”
“Ridiculous child!” cried his mother. “You think you’re so holy and
truthful, but really it’s only abominable conceit. Do you suppose that
a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say? I
hope he boxed your ears. How dare you say no?”
“Oh, do keep quiet, mother! I had to say no when I couldn’t say yes. I
tried to laugh as if I didn’t mean what I said, and, as Cecil laughed
too, and went away, it may be all right. But I feel my foot’s in it.
Oh, do keep quiet, though, and let a man do some work.”
“No,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, with the air of one who has considered the
subject, “I shall not keep quiet. You know all that has passed between
them in Rome; you know why he is down here, and yet you deliberately
insult him, and try to turn him out of my house.”
“Not a bit!” he pleaded. “I only let out I didn’t like him. I don’t
hate him, but I don’t like him. What I mind is that he’ll tell Lucy.”
He glanced at the curtains dismally.
“Well, _I_ like him,” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “I know his mother; he’s
good, he’s clever, he’s rich, he’s well connected—Oh, you needn’t kick
the piano! He’s well connected—I’ll say it again if you like: he’s well
connected.” She paused, as if rehearsing her eulogy, but her face
remained dissatisfied. She added: “And he has beautiful manners.”
“I liked him till just now. I suppose it’s having him spoiling Lucy’s
first week at home; and it’s also something that Mr. Beebe said, not
knowing.”
“Mr. Beebe?” said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. “I don’t
see how Mr. Beebe comes in.”
“You know Mr. Beebe’s funny way, when you never quite know what he
means. He said: ‘Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor.’ I was very cute, I
asked him what he meant. He said ‘Oh, he’s like me—better detached.’ I
couldn’t make him say any more, but it set me thinking. Since Cecil has
come after Lucy he hasn’t been so pleasant, at least—I can’t explain.”
“You never can, dear. But I can. You are jealous of Cecil because he
may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties.”
The explanation seemed plausible, and Freddy tried to accept it. But at
the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust. Cecil praised one
too much for being athletic. Was that it? Cecil made one talk in one’s
own way. This tired one. Was that it? And Cecil was the kind of fellow
who would never wear another fellow’s cap. Unaware of his own
profundity, Freddy checked himself. He must be jealous, or he would not
dislike a man for such foolish reasons.
“Will this do?” called his mother. “‘Dear Mrs. Vyse,—Cecil has just
asked my permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes
it.’ Then I put in at the top, ‘and I have told Lucy so.’ I must write
the letter out again—‘and I have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very
uncertain, and in these days young people must decide for themselves.’
I said that because I didn’t want Mrs. Vyse to think us old-fashioned.
She goes in for lectures and improving her mind, and all the time a
thick layer of flue under the beds, and the maid’s dirty thumb-marks
where you turn on the electric light. She keeps that flat abominably—”
“Suppose Lucy marries Cecil, would she live in a flat, or in the
country?”
“Don’t interrupt so foolishly. Where was I? Oh yes—‘Young people must
decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your son, because she
tells me everything, and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her
first.’ No, I’ll cross that last bit out—it looks patronizing. I’ll
stop at ‘because she tells me everything.’ Or shall I cross that out,
too?”
“Cross it out, too,” said Freddy.
Mrs. Honeychurch left it in.
“Then the whole thing runs: ‘Dear Mrs. Vyse.—Cecil has just asked my
permission about it, and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it, and I
have told Lucy so. But Lucy seems very uncertain, and in these days
young people must decide for themselves. I know that Lucy likes your
son, because she tells me everything. But I do not know—’”
“Look out!” cried Freddy.
The curtains parted.
Cecil’s first movement was one of irritation. He couldn’t bear the
Honeychurch habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture.
Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch, and sent them swinging
down their poles. Light entered. There was revealed a terrace, such as
is owned by many villas with trees each side of it, and on it a little
rustic seat, and two flower-beds. But it was transfigured by the view
beyond, for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the
Sussex Weald. Lucy, who was in the little seat, seemed on the edge of a
green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world.
Cecil entered.
Appearing thus late in the story, Cecil must be at once described. He
was medieval. Like a Gothic statue. Tall and refined, with shoulders
that seemed braced square by an effort of the will, and a head that was
tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled
those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral.
Well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he remained
in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as
self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,
worshipped as asceticism. A Gothic statue implies celibacy, just as a
Greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what Mr. Beebe
meant. And Freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same
when he failed to imagine Cecil wearing another fellow’s cap.
Mrs. Honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards
her young acquaintance.
“Oh, Cecil!” she exclaimed—“oh, Cecil, do tell me!”
“I promessi sposi,” said he.
They stared at him anxiously.
“She has accepted me,” he said, and the sound of the thing in English
made him flush and smile with pleasure, and look more human.
“I am so glad,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, while Freddy proffered a hand
that was yellow with chemicals. They wished that they also knew
Italian, for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected
with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones. We are
obliged to become vaguely poetic, or to take refuge in Scriptural
reminiscences.
“Welcome as one of the family!” said Mrs. Honeychurch, waving her hand
at the furniture. “This is indeed a joyous day! I feel sure that you
will make our dear Lucy happy.”
“I hope so,” replied the young man, shifting his eyes to the ceiling.
“We mothers—” simpered Mrs. Honeychurch, and then realized that she was
affected, sentimental, bombastic—all the things she hated most. Why
could she not be Freddy, who stood stiff in the middle of the room;
looking very cross and almost handsome?
“I say, Lucy!” called Cecil, for conversation seemed to flag.
Lucy rose from the seat. She moved across the lawn and smiled in at
them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. Then she saw
her brother’s face. Her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. He
said, “Steady on!”
“Not a kiss for me?” asked her mother.
Lucy kissed her also.
“Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all
about it?” Cecil suggested. “And I’d stop here and tell my mother.”
“We go with Lucy?” said Freddy, as if taking orders.
“Yes, you go with Lucy.”
They passed into the sunlight. Cecil watched them cross the terrace,
and descend out of sight by the steps. They would descend—he knew their
ways—past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,
until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of
the potatoes and the peas, the great event would be discussed.
Smiling indulgently, he lit a cigarette, and rehearsed the events that
had led to such a happy conclusion.
He had known Lucy for several years, but only as a commonplace girl who
happened to be musical. He could still remember his depression that
afternoon at Rome, when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of
the blue, and demanded to be taken to St. Peter’s. That day she had
seemed a typical tourist—shrill, crude, and gaunt with travel. But
Italy worked some marvel in her. It gave her light, and—which he held
more precious—it gave her shadow. Soon he detected in her a wonderful
reticence. She was like a woman of Leonardo da Vinci’s, whom we love
not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us.
The things are assuredly not of this life; no woman of Leonardo’s could
have anything so vulgar as a “story.” She did develop most wonderfully
day by day.
So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if
not to passion, at least to a profound uneasiness. Already at Rome he
had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other. It had
touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion. Her
refusal had been clear and gentle; after it—as the horrid phrase
went—she had been exactly the same to him as before. Three months
later, on the margin of Italy, among the flower-clad Alps, he had asked
her again in bald, traditional language. She reminded him of a Leonardo
more than ever; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock;
at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with
immeasurable plains behind her. He walked home with her unashamed,
feeling not at all like a rejected suitor. The things that really
mattered were unshaken.
So now he had asked her once more, and, clear and gentle as ever, she
had accepted him, giving no coy reasons for her delay, but simply
saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy. His
mother, too, would be pleased; she had counselled the step; he must
write her a long account.
Glancing at his hand, in case any of Freddy’s chemicals had come off on
it, he moved to the writing table. There he saw “Dear Mrs. Vyse,”
followed by many erasures. He recoiled without reading any more, and
after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere, and pencilled a note on
his knee.
Then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as
the first, and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner
drawing-room more distinctive. With that outlook it should have been a
successful room, but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it; he
could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs.
Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair, those varnished
book-cases, that writing-table. The table recalled Mrs. Honeychurch’s
letter. He did not want to read that letter—his temptations never lay
in that direction; but he worried about it none the less. It was his
own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted
her support in his third attempt to win Lucy; he wanted to feel that
others, no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked
their permission. Mrs. Honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in
essentials, while as for Freddy—“He is only a boy,” he reflected. “I
represent all that he despises. Why should he want me for a
brother-in-law?”
The Honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize that
Lucy was of another clay; and perhaps—he did not put it very
definitely—he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as
soon as possible.
“Mr. Beebe!” said the maid, and the new rector of Summer Street was
shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to Lucy’s
praise of him in her letters from Florence.
Cecil greeted him rather critically.
“I’ve come for tea, Mr. Vyse. Do you suppose that I shall get it?”
“I should say so. Food is the thing one does get here—Don’t sit in that
chair; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it.”
“Pfui!”
“I know,” said Cecil. “I know. I can’t think why Mrs. Honeychurch
allows it.”
For Cecil considered the bone and the Maples’ furniture separately; he
did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the
life that he desired.
“I’ve come for tea and for gossip. Isn’t this news?”
“News? I don’t understand you,” said Cecil. “News?”
Mr. Beebe, whose news was of a very different nature, prattled forward.
“I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up; I have every reason to hope that I
am first in the field. He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack!”
“Has he indeed?” said Cecil, trying to recover himself. Into what a
grotesque mistake had he fallen! Was it likely that a clergyman and a
gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? But
his stiffness remained, and, though he asked who Cissie and Albert
might be, he still thought Mr. Beebe rather a bounder.
“Unpardonable question! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not
to have met Cissie and Albert, the semi-detached villas that have been
run up opposite the church! I’ll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you.”
“I’m shockingly stupid over local affairs,” said the young man
languidly. “I can’t even remember the difference between a Parish
Council and a Local Government Board. Perhaps there is no difference,
or perhaps those aren’t the right names. I only go into the country to
see my friends and to enjoy the scenery. It is very remiss of me. Italy
and London are the only places where I don’t feel to exist on
sufferance.”
Mr. Beebe, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert,
determined to shift the subject.
“Let me see, Mr. Vyse—I forget—what is your profession?”
“I have no profession,” said Cecil. “It is another example of my
decadence. My attitude—quite an indefensible one—is that so long as I
am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like. I know I ought
to be getting money out of people, or devoting myself to things I don’t
care a straw about, but somehow, I’ve not been able to begin.”
“You are very fortunate,” said Mr. Beebe. “It is a wonderful
opportunity, the possession of leisure.”
His voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to
answering naturally. He felt, as all who have regular occupation must
feel, that others should have it also.
“I am glad that you approve. I daren’t face the healthy person—for
example, Freddy Honeychurch.”
“Oh, Freddy’s a good sort, isn’t he?”
“Admirable. The sort who has made England what she is.”
Cecil wondered at himself. Why, on this day of all others, was he so
hopelessly contrary? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively
after Mr. Beebe’s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular
regard. Then he flattered the clergyman, praised his
liberal-mindedness, his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and
science.
“Where are the others?” said Mr. Beebe at last, “I insist on extracting
tea before evening service.”
“I suppose Anne never told them you were here. In this house one is so
coached in the servants the day one arrives. The fault of Anne is that
she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly, and kicks the
chair-legs with her feet. The faults of Mary—I forget the faults of
Mary, but they are very grave. Shall we look in the garden?”
“I know the faults of Mary. She leaves the dust-pans standing on the
stairs.”
“The fault of Euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the
suet sufficiently small.”
They both laughed, and things began to go better.
“The faults of Freddy—” Cecil continued.
“Ah, he has too many. No one but his mother can remember the faults of
Freddy. Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch; they are not innumerable.”
“She has none,” said the young man, with grave sincerity.
“I quite agree. At present she has none.”
“At present?”
“I’m not cynical. I’m only thinking of my pet theory about Miss
Honeychurch. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so
wonderfully, and live so quietly? I suspect that one day she will be
wonderful in both. The water-tight compartments in her will break down,
and music and life will mingle. Then we shall have her heroically good,
heroically bad—too heroic, perhaps, to be good or bad.”
Cecil found his companion interesting.
“And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes?”
“Well, I must say I’ve only seen her at Tunbridge Wells, where she was
not wonderful, and at Florence. Since I came to Summer Street she has
been away. You saw her, didn’t you, at Rome and in the Alps. Oh, I
forgot; of course, you knew her before. No, she wasn’t wonderful in
Florence either, but I kept on expecting that she would be.”
“In what way?”
Conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and
down the terrace.
“I could as easily tell you what tune she’ll play next. There was
simply the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. I can
show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary: Miss Honeychurch as a
kite, Miss Bartlett holding the string. Picture number two: the string
breaks.”
The sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he
viewed things artistically. At the time he had given surreptitious tugs
to the string himself.
“But the string never broke?”
“No. I mightn’t have seen Miss Honeychurch rise, but I should certainly
have heard Miss Bartlett fall.”
“It has broken now,” said the young man in low, vibrating tones.
Immediately he realized that of all the conceited, ludicrous,
contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst. He
cursed his love of metaphor; had he suggested that he was a star and
that Lucy was soaring up to reach him?
“Broken? What do you mean?”
“I meant,” said Cecil stiffly, “that she is going to marry me.”
The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he
could not keep out of his voice.
“I am sorry; I must apologize. I had no idea you were intimate with
her, or I should never have talked in this flippant, superficial way.
Mr. Vyse, you ought to have stopped me.” And down the garden he saw
Lucy herself; yes, he was disappointed.
Cecil, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies, drew down
his mouth at the corners. Was this the reception his action would get
from the world? Of course, he despised the world as a whole; every
thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. But he was
sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.
Occasionally he could be quite crude.
“I am sorry I have given you a shock,” he said dryly. “I fear that
Lucy’s choice does not meet with your approval.”
“Not that. But you ought to have stopped me. I know Miss Honeychurch
only a little as time goes. Perhaps I oughtn’t to have discussed her so
freely with any one; certainly not with you.”
“You are conscious of having said something indiscreet?”
Mr. Beebe pulled himself together. Really, Mr. Vyse had the art of
placing one in the most tiresome positions. He was driven to use the
prerogatives of his profession.
“No, I have said nothing indiscreet. I foresaw at Florence that her
quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. I realized
dimly enough that she might take some momentous step. She has taken it.
She has learnt—you will let me talk freely, as I have begun freely—she
has learnt what it is to love: the greatest lesson, some people will
tell you, that our earthly life provides.” It was now time for him to
wave his hat at the approaching trio. He did not omit to do so. “She
has learnt through you,” and if his voice was still clerical, it was
now also sincere; “let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable
to her.”
“Grazie tante!” said Cecil, who did not like parsons.
“Have you heard?” shouted Mrs. Honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping
garden. “Oh, Mr. Beebe, have you heard the news?”
Freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. Youth seldom
criticizes the accomplished fact.
“Indeed I have!” he cried. He looked at Lucy. In her presence he could
not act the parson any longer—at all events not without apology. “Mrs.
Honeychurch, I’m going to do what I am always supposed to do, but
generally I’m too shy. I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them,
grave and gay, great and small. I want them all their lives to be
supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife, as father and
mother. And now I want my tea.”
“You only asked for it just in time,” the lady retorted. “How dare you
be serious at Windy Corner?”
He took his tone from her. There was no more heavy beneficence, no more
attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures. None
of them dared or was able to be serious any more.
An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all
who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. Away from it, in the
solitude of their rooms, Mr. Beebe, and even Freddy, might again be
critical. But in its presence and in the presence of each other they
were sincerely hilarious. It has a strange power, for it compels not
only the lips, but the very heart. The chief parallel to compare one
great thing with another—is the power over us of a temple of some alien
creed. Standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel
sentimental. Inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become
true believers, in case any true believer should be present.
So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon
they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant
tea-party. If they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their
hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. Anne,
putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated
them greatly. They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she
gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. Mr. Beebe chirruped.
Freddy was at his wittiest, referring to Cecil as the “Fiasco”—family
honoured pun on fiance. Mrs. Honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised
well as a mother-in-law. As for Lucy and Cecil, for whom the temple had
been built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as
earnest worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of
joy.
Chapter IX
Lucy As a Work of Art
A few days after the engagement was announced Mrs. Honeychurch made
Lucy and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood,
for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying
a presentable man.
Cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was
very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with Lucy, and his
long, fair face responding when Lucy spoke to him. People congratulated
Mrs. Honeychurch, which is, I believe, a social blunder, but it pleased
her, and she introduced Cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy
dowagers.
At tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over Lucy’s
figured silk, and though Lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned
nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated
by a sympathetic maid. They were gone some time, and Cecil was left
with the dowagers. When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had
been.
“Do you go to much of this sort of thing?” he asked when they were
driving home.
“Oh, now and then,” said Lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.
“Is it typical of country society?”
“I suppose so. Mother, would it be?”
“Plenty of society,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who was trying to remember
the hang of one of the dresses.
Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, Cecil bent towards Lucy and
said:
“To me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.”
“I am so sorry that you were stranded.”
“Not that, but the congratulations. It is so disgusting, the way an
engagement is regarded as public property—a kind of waste place where
every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment. All those old women
smirking!”
“One has to go through it, I suppose. They won’t notice us so much next
time.”
“But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong. An
engagement—horrid word in the first place—is a private matter, and
should be treated as such.”
Yet the smirking old women, however wrong individually, were racially
correct. The spirit of the generations had smiled through them,
rejoicing in the engagement of Cecil and Lucy because it promised the
continuance of life on earth. To Cecil and Lucy it promised something
quite different—personal love. Hence Cecil’s irritation and Lucy’s
belief that his irritation was just.
“How tiresome!” she said. “Couldn’t you have escaped to tennis?”
“I don’t play tennis—at least, not in public. The neighbourhood is
deprived of the romance of me being athletic. Such romance as I have is
that of the Inglese Italianato.”
“Inglese Italianato?”
“E un diavolo incarnato! You know the proverb?”
She did not. Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a
quiet winter in Rome with his mother. But Cecil, since his engagement,
had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from
possessing.
“Well,” said he, “I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me. There
are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them, and I must
accept them.”
“We all have our limitations, I suppose,” said wise Lucy.
“Sometimes they are forced on us, though,” said Cecil, who saw from her
remark that she did not quite understand his position.
“How?”
“It makes a difference doesn’t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,
or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?”
She thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.
“Difference?” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, suddenly alert. “I don’t see any
difference. Fences are fences, especially when they are in the same
place.”
“We were speaking of motives,” said Cecil, on whom the interruption
jarred.
“My dear Cecil, look here.” She spread out her knees and perched her
card-case on her lap. “This is me. That’s Windy Corner. The rest of the
pattern is the other people. Motives are all very well, but the fence
comes here.”
“We weren’t talking of real fences,” said Lucy, laughing.
“Oh, I see, dear—poetry.”
She leant placidly back. Cecil wondered why Lucy had been amused.
“I tell you who has no ‘fences,’ as you call them,” she said, “and
that’s Mr. Beebe.”
“A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.”
Lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect
what they meant. She missed Cecil’s epigram, but grasped the feeling
that prompted it.
“Don’t you like Mr. Beebe?” she asked thoughtfully.
“I never said so!” he cried. “I consider him far above the average. I
only denied—” And he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was
brilliant.
“Now, a clergyman that I do hate,” said she wanting to say something
sympathetic, “a clergyman that does have fences, and the most dreadful
ones, is Mr. Eager, the English chaplain at Florence. He was truly
insincere—not merely the manner unfortunate. He was a snob, and so
conceited, and he did say such unkind things.”
“What sort of things?”
“There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his
wife.”
“Perhaps he had.”
“No!”
“Why ‘no’?”
“He was such a nice old man, I’m sure.”
Cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.
“Well, I did try to sift the thing. Mr. Eager would never come to the
point. He prefers it vague—said the old man had ‘practically’ murdered
his wife—had murdered her in the sight of God.”
“Hush, dear!” said Mrs. Honeychurch absently.
“But isn’t it intolerable that a person whom we’re told to imitate
should go round spreading slander? It was, I believe, chiefly owing to
him that the old man was dropped. People pretended he was vulgar, but
he certainly wasn’t that.”
“Poor old man! What was his name?”
“Harris,” said Lucy glibly.
“Let’s hope that Mrs. Harris there warn’t no sich person,” said her
mother.
Cecil nodded intelligently.
“Isn’t Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type?” he asked.
“I don’t know. I hate him. I’ve heard him lecture on Giotto. I hate
him. Nothing can hide a petty nature. I _hate_ him.”
“My goodness gracious me, child!” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “You’ll blow
my head off! Whatever is there to shout over? I forbid you and Cecil to
hate any more clergymen.”
He smiled. There was indeed something rather incongruous in Lucy’s
moral outburst over Mr. Eager. It was as if one should see the Leonardo
on the ceiling of the Sistine. He longed to hint to her that not here
lay her vocation; that a woman’s power and charm reside in mystery, not
in muscular rant. But possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the
beautiful creature, but shows that she is alive. After a moment, he
contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain
approval. He forebore to repress the sources of youth.
Nature—simplest of topics, he thought—lay around them. He praised the
pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted
the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road. The
outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went
wrong in a question of fact. Mrs. Honeychurch’s mouth twitched when he
spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.
“I count myself a lucky person,” he concluded, “When I’m in London I
feel I could never live out of it. When I’m in the country I feel the
same about the country. After all, I do believe that birds and trees
and the sky are the most wonderful things in life, and that the people
who live amongst them must be the best. It’s true that in nine cases
out of ten they don’t seem to notice anything. The country gentleman
and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of
companions. Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of
Nature which is denied to us of the town. Do you feel that, Mrs.
Honeychurch?”
Mrs. Honeychurch started and smiled. She had not been attending. Cecil,
who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt
irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.
Lucy had not attended either. Her brow was wrinkled, and she still
looked furiously cross—the result, he concluded, of too much moral
gymnastics. It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an
August wood.
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,’” he quoted, and
touched her knee with his own.
She flushed again and said: “What height?”
“‘Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height,
What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang).
In height and in the splendour of the hills?’
Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch’s advice and hate clergymen no more.
What’s this place?”
“Summer Street, of course,” said Lucy, and roused herself.
The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
Pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was
occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled
spire. Mr. Beebe’s house was near the church. In height it scarcely
exceeded the cottages. Some great mansions were at hand, but they were
hidden in the trees. The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the
shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly
little villas—the villas that had competed with Cecil’s engagement,
having been acquired by Sir Harry Otway the very afternoon that Lucy
had been acquired by Cecil.
“Cissie” was the name of one of these villas, “Albert” of the other.
These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden
gates, but appeared a second time on the porches, where they followed
the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals. “Albert”
was inhabited. His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and
lobelias and polished shells. His little windows were chastely swathed
in Nottingham lace. “Cissie” was to let. Three notice-boards, belonging
to Dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising
fact. Her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn
was yellow with dandelions.
“The place is ruined!” said the ladies mechanically. “Summer Street
will never be the same again.”
As the carriage passed, “Cissie’s” door opened, and a gentleman came
out of her.
“Stop!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
“Here’s Sir Harry. Now we shall know. Sir Harry, pull those things down
at once!”
Sir Harry Otway—who need not be described—came to the carriage and said
“Mrs. Honeychurch, I meant to. I can’t, I really can’t turn out Miss
Flack.”
“Am I not always right? She ought to have gone before the contract was
signed. Does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephew’s
time?”
“But what can I do?” He lowered his voice. “An old lady, so very
vulgar, and almost bedridden.”
“Turn her out,” said Cecil bravely.
Sir Harry sighed, and looked at the villas mournfully. He had had full
warning of Mr. Flack’s intentions, and might have bought the plot
before building commenced: but he was apathetic and dilatory. He had
known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it
being spoilt. Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone, and
the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm.
He called on Mr. Flack, the local builder,—a most reasonable and
respectful man—who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic
roof, but pointed out that slates were cheaper. He ventured to differ,
however, about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches
to the frames of the bow windows, saying that, for his part, he liked
to relieve the façade by a bit of decoration. Sir Harry hinted that a
column, if possible, should be structural as well as decorative.
Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, “and
all the capitals different—one with dragons in the foliage, another
approaching to the Ionian style, another introducing Mrs. Flack’s
initials—every one different.” For he had read his Ruskin. He built his
villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an
immovable aunt into one of them did Sir Harry buy.
This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness
as he leant on Mrs. Honeychurch’s carriage. He had failed in his duties
to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
He had spent money, and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever.
All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “Cissie”—someone
really desirable.
“The rent is absurdly low,” he told them, “and perhaps I am an easy
landlord. But it is such an awkward size. It is too large for the
peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.”
Cecil had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or
despise Sir Harry for despising them. The latter impulse seemed the
more fruitful.
“You ought to find a tenant at once,” he said maliciously. “It would be
a perfect paradise for a bank clerk.”
“Exactly!” said Sir Harry excitedly. “That is exactly what I fear, Mr.
Vyse. It will attract the wrong type of people. The train service has
improved—a fatal improvement, to my mind. And what are five miles from
a station in these days of bicycles?”
“Rather a strenuous clerk it would be,” said Lucy.
Cecil, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness, replied
that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most
appalling rate. She saw that he was laughing at their harmless
neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.
“Sir Harry!” she exclaimed, “I have an idea. How would you like
spinsters?”
“My dear Lucy, it would be splendid. Do you know any such?”
“Yes; I met them abroad.”
“Gentlewomen?” he asked tentatively.
“Yes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. I heard from them
last week—Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan. I’m really not joking.
They are quite the right people. Mr. Beebe knows them, too. May I tell
them to write to you?”
“Indeed you may!” he cried. “Here we are with the difficulty solved
already. How delightful it is! Extra facilities—please tell them they
shall have extra facilities, for I shall have no agents’ fees. Oh, the
agents! The appalling people they have sent me! One woman, when I
wrote—a tactful letter, you know—asking her to explain her social
position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. As if
one cares about that! And several references I took up were most
unsatisfactory—people swindlers, or not respectable. And oh, the
deceit! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. The
deceit of the most promising people. My dear Lucy, the deceit!”
She nodded.
“My advice,” put in Mrs. Honeychurch, “is to have nothing to do with
Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. I know the type. Preserve me
from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them
that make the house smell stuffy. It’s a sad thing, but I’d far rather
let to some one who is going up in the world than to someone who has
come down.”
“I think I follow you,” said Sir Harry; “but it is, as you say, a very
sad thing.”
“The Misses Alan aren’t that!” cried Lucy.
“Yes, they are,” said Cecil. “I haven’t met them but I should say they
were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood.”
“Don’t listen to him, Sir Harry—he’s tiresome.”
“It’s I who am tiresome,” he replied. “I oughtn’t to come with my
troubles to young people. But really I am so worried, and Lady Otway
will only say that I cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no
real help.”
“Then may I write to my Misses Alan?”
“Please!”
But his eye wavered when Mrs. Honeychurch exclaimed:
“Beware! They are certain to have canaries. Sir Harry, beware of
canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then
the mice come. Beware of women altogether. Only let to a man.”
“Really—” he murmured gallantly, though he saw the wisdom of her
remark.
“Men don’t gossip over tea-cups. If they get drunk, there’s an end of
them—they lie down comfortably and sleep it off. If they’re vulgar,
they somehow keep it to themselves. It doesn’t spread so. Give me a
man—of course, provided he’s clean.”
Sir Harry blushed. Neither he nor Cecil enjoyed these open compliments
to their sex. Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much
distinction. He suggested that Mrs. Honeychurch, if she had time,
should descend from the carriage and inspect “Cissie” for herself. She
was delighted. Nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a
house. Domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they
were on a small scale.
Cecil pulled Lucy back as she followed her mother.
“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “what if we two walk home and leave you?”
“Certainly!” was her cordial reply.
Sir Harry likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them. He beamed
at them knowingly, said, “Aha! young people, young people!” and then
hastened to unlock the house.
“Hopeless vulgarian!” exclaimed Cecil, almost before they were out of
earshot.
“Oh, Cecil!”
“I can’t help it. It would be wrong not to loathe that man.”
“He isn’t clever, but really he is nice.”
“No, Lucy, he stands for all that is bad in country life. In London he
would keep his place. He would belong to a brainless club, and his wife
would give brainless dinner parties. But down here he acts the little
god with his gentility, and his patronage, and his sham aesthetics, and
every one—even your mother—is taken in.”
“All that you say is quite true,” said Lucy, though she felt
discouraged. “I wonder whether—whether it matters so very much.”
“It matters supremely. Sir Harry is the essence of that garden-party.
Oh, goodness, how cross I feel! How I do hope he’ll get some vulgar
tenant in that villa—some woman so really vulgar that he’ll notice it.
_Gentlefolks!_ Ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! But let’s
forget him.”
This Lucy was glad enough to do. If Cecil disliked Sir Harry Otway and
Mr. Beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered
to her would escape? For instance, Freddy. Freddy was neither clever,
nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented Cecil from saying, any
minute, “It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy”? And what would she
reply? Further than Freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety
enough. She could only assure herself that Cecil had known Freddy some
time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,
during the last few days, which was an accident, perhaps.
“Which way shall we go?” she asked him.
Nature—simplest of topics, she thought—was around them. Summer Street
lay deep in the woods, and she had stopped where a footpath diverged
from the highroad.
“Are there two ways?”
“Perhaps the road is more sensible, as we’re got up smart.”
“I’d rather go through the wood,” said Cecil, With that subdued
irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon. “Why is it,
Lucy, that you always say the road? Do you know that you have never
once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged?”
“Haven’t I? The wood, then,” said Lucy, startled at his queerness, but
pretty sure that he would explain later; it was not his habit to leave
her in doubt as to his meaning.
She led the way into the whispering pines, and sure enough he did
explain before they had gone a dozen yards.
“I had got an idea—I dare say wrongly—that you feel more at home with
me in a room.”
“A room?” she echoed, hopelessly bewildered.
“Yes. Or, at the most, in a garden, or on a road. Never in the real
country like this.”
“Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean? I have never felt anything of the
sort. You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person.”
“I don’t know that you aren’t. I connect you with a view—a certain type
of view. Why shouldn’t you connect me with a room?”
She reflected a moment, and then said, laughing:
“Do you know that you’re right? I do. I must be a poetess after all.
When I think of you it’s always as in a room. How funny!”
To her surprise, he seemed annoyed.
“A drawing-room, pray? With no view?”
“Yes, with no view, I fancy. Why not?”
“I’d rather,” he said reproachfully, “that you connected me with the
open air.”
She said again, “Oh, Cecil, whatever do you mean?”
As no explanation was forthcoming, she shook off the subject as too
difficult for a girl, and led him further into the wood, pausing every
now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of
the trees. She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy
Corner ever since she could walk alone; she had played at losing Freddy
in it, when Freddy was a purple-faced baby; and though she had been to
Italy, it had lost none of its charm.
Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines—another tiny
green alp, solitary this time, and holding in its bosom a shallow pool.
She exclaimed, “The Sacred Lake!”
“Why do you call it that?”
“I can’t remember why. I suppose it comes out of some book. It’s only a
puddle now, but you see that stream going through it? Well, a good deal
of water comes down after heavy rains, and can’t get away at once, and
the pool becomes quite large and beautiful. Then Freddy used to bathe
there. He is very fond of it.”
“And you?”
He meant, “Are you fond of it?” But she answered dreamily, “I bathed
here, too, till I was found out. Then there was a row.”
At another time he might have been shocked, for he had depths of
prudishness within him. But now? with his momentary cult of the fresh
air, he was delighted at her admirable simplicity. He looked at her as
she stood by the pool’s edge. She was got up smart, as she phrased it,
and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its
own, but blooms abruptly out of a world of green.
“Who found you out?”
“Charlotte,” she murmured. “She was stopping with us.
Charlotte—Charlotte.”
“Poor girl!”
She smiled gravely. A certain scheme, from which hitherto he had
shrunk, now appeared practical.
“Lucy!”
“Yes, I suppose we ought to be going,” was her reply.
“Lucy, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before.”
At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards
him.
“What, Cecil?”
“Hitherto never—not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry
me—”
He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were
observed. His courage had gone.
“Yes?”
“Up to now I have never kissed you.”
She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately.
“No—more you have,” she stammered.
“Then I ask you—may I now?”
“Of course, you may, Cecil. You might before. I can’t run at you, you
know.”
At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities. Her
reply was inadequate. She gave such a business-like lift to her veil.
As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil. As he
touched her, his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened
between them.
Such was the embrace. He considered, with truth, that it had been a
failure. Passion should believe itself irresistible. It should forget
civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined
nature. Above all, it should never ask for leave where there is a right
of way. Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy—nay, as any young
man behind the counter would have done? He recast the scene. Lucy was
standing flowerlike by the water, he rushed up and took her in his
arms; she rebuked him, permitted him and revered him ever after for his
manliness. For he believed that women revere men for their manliness.
They left the pool in silence, after this one salutation. He waited for
her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts. At
last she spoke, and with fitting gravity.
“Emerson was the name, not Harris.”
“What name?”
“The old man’s.”
“What old man?”
“That old man I told you about. The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to.”
He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had
ever had.
Chapter X
Cecil as a Humourist
The society out of which Cecil proposed to rescue Lucy was perhaps no
very splendid affair, yet it was more splendid than her antecedents
entitled her to. Her father, a prosperous local solicitor, had built
Windy Corner, as a speculation at the time the district was opening up,
and, falling in love with his own creation, had ended by living there
himself. Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and
others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk
barrier of the downs. Most of these houses were larger than Windy
Corner, and were filled by people who came, not from the district, but
from London, and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an
indigenous aristocracy. He was inclined to be frightened, but his wife
accepted the situation without either pride or humility. “I cannot
think what people are doing,” she would say, “but it is extremely
fortunate for the children.” She called everywhere; her calls were
returned with enthusiasm, and by the time people found out that she was
not exactly of their _milieu_, they liked her, and it did not seem to
matter. When Mr. Honeychurch died, he had the satisfaction—which few
honest solicitors despise—of leaving his family rooted in the best
society obtainable.
The best obtainable. Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull,
and Lucy realized this more vividly since her return from Italy.
Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning—their kindly
affluence, their inexplosive religion, their dislike of paper-bags,
orange-peel, and broken bottles. A Radical out and out, she learnt to
speak with horror of Suburbia. Life, so far as she troubled to conceive
it, was a circle of rich, pleasant people, with identical interests and
identical foes. In this circle, one thought, married, and died. Outside
it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter, just as the
London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in
the northern hills. But, in Italy, where any one who chooses may warm
himself in equality, as in the sun, this conception of life vanished.
Her senses expanded; she felt that there was no one whom she might not
get to like, that social barriers were irremovable, doubtless, but not
particularly high. You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant’s
olive-yard in the Apennines, and he is glad to see you. She returned
with new eyes.
So did Cecil; but Italy had quickened Cecil, not to tolerance, but to
irritation. He saw that the local society was narrow, but, instead of
saying, “Does that very much matter?” he rebelled, and tried to
substitute for it the society he called broad. He did not realize that
Lucy had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities
that create a tenderness in time, and that though her eyes saw its
defects, her heart refused to despise it entirely. Nor did he realize a
more important point—that if she was too great for this society, she
was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal
intercourse would alone satisfy her. A rebel she was, but not of the
kind he understood—a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but
equality beside the man she loved. For Italy was offering her the most
priceless of all possessions—her own soul.
Playing bumble-puppy with Minnie Beebe, niece to the rector, and aged
thirteen—an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in
striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net
and immoderately bounce; some hit Mrs. Honeychurch; others are lost.
The sentence is confused, but the better illustrates Lucy’s state of
mind, for she was trying to talk to Mr. Beebe at the same time.
“Oh, it has been such a nuisance—first he, then they—no one knowing
what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.”
“But they really are coming now,” said Mr. Beebe. “I wrote to Miss
Teresa a few days ago—she was wondering how often the butcher called,
and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. They
are coming. I heard from them this morning.
“I shall hate those Miss Alans!” Mrs. Honeychurch cried. “Just because
they’re old and silly one’s expected to say ‘How sweet!’ I hate their
‘if’-ing and ‘but’-ing and ‘and’-ing. And poor Lucy—serve her
right—worn to a shadow.”
Mr. Beebe watched the shadow springing and shouting over the
tennis-court. Cecil was absent—one did not play bumble-puppy when he
was there.
“Well, if they are coming—No, Minnie, not Saturn.” Saturn was a
tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn. When in motion his orb was
encircled by a ring. “If they are coming, Sir Harry will let them move
in before the twenty-ninth, and he will cross out the clause about
whitewashing the ceilings, because it made them nervous, and put in the
fair wear and tear one.—That doesn’t count. I told you not Saturn.”
“Saturn’s all right for bumble-puppy,” cried Freddy, joining them.
“Minnie, don’t you listen to her.”
“Saturn doesn’t bounce.”
“Saturn bounces enough.”
“No, he doesn’t.”
“Well; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil.”
“Hush, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch.
“But look at Lucy—complaining of Saturn, and all the time’s got the
Beautiful White Devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. That’s right,
Minnie, go for her—get her over the shins with the racquet—get her over
the shins!”
Lucy fell, the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand.
Mr. Beebe picked it up, and said: “The name of this ball is Vittoria
Corombona, please.” But his correction passed unheeded.
Freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to
fury, and in half a minute he had transformed Minnie from a
well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. Up in the house Cecil
heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not
come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. He was not a coward and
bore necessary pain as well as any man. But he hated the physical
violence of the young. How right it was! Sure enough it ended in a cry.
“I wish the Miss Alans could see this,” observed Mr. Beebe, just as
Lucy, who was nursing the injured Minnie, was in turn lifted off her
feet by her brother.
“Who are the Miss Alans?” Freddy panted.
“They have taken Cissie Villa.”
“That wasn’t the name—”
Here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the
grass. An interval elapses.
“Wasn’t what name?” asked Lucy, with her brother’s head in her lap.
“Alan wasn’t the name of the people Sir Harry’s let to.”
“Nonsense, Freddy! You know nothing about it.”
“Nonsense yourself! I’ve this minute seen him. He said to me: ‘Ahem!
Honeychurch,’”—Freddy was an indifferent mimic—“‘ahem! ahem! I have at
last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants.’ I said, ‘ooray, old boy!’
and slapped him on the back.”
“Exactly. The Miss Alans?”
“Rather not. More like Anderson.”
“Oh, good gracious, there isn’t going to be another muddle!” Mrs.
Honeychurch exclaimed. “Do you notice, Lucy, I’m always right? I _said_
don’t interfere with Cissie Villa. I’m always right. I’m quite uneasy
at being always right so often.”
“It’s only another muddle of Freddy’s. Freddy doesn’t even know the
name of the people he pretends have taken it instead.”
“Yes, I do. I’ve got it. Emerson.”
“What name?”
“Emerson. I’ll bet you anything you like.”
“What a weathercock Sir Harry is,” said Lucy quietly. “I wish I had
never bothered over it at all.”
Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. Mr. Beebe,
whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that _that_ was
the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.
Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted Mrs. Honeychurch
from the contemplation of her own abilities.
“Emerson, Freddy? Do you know what Emersons they are?”
“I don’t know whether they’re any Emersons,” retorted Freddy, who was
democratic. Like his sister and like most young people, he was
naturally attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact
that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure.
“I trust they are the right sort of person. All right, Lucy”—she was
sitting up again—“I see you looking down your nose and thinking your
mother’s a snob. But there is a right sort and a wrong sort, and it’s
affectation to pretend there isn’t.”
“Emerson’s a common enough name,” Lucy remarked.
She was gazing sideways. Seated on a promontory herself, she could see
the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the
Weald. The further one descended the garden, the more glorious was this
lateral view.
“I was merely going to remark, Freddy, that I trusted they were no
relations of Emerson the philosopher, a most trying man. Pray, does
that satisfy you?”
“Oh, yes,” he grumbled. “And you will be satisfied, too, for they’re
friends of Cecil; so”—elaborate irony—“you and the other country
families will be able to call in perfect safety.”
“_Cecil?_” exclaimed Lucy.
“Don’t be rude, dear,” said his mother placidly. “Lucy, don’t screech.
It’s a new bad habit you’re getting into.”
“But has Cecil—”
“Friends of Cecil’s,” he repeated, “‘and so really dee-sire-rebel.
Ahem! Honeychurch, I have just telegraphed to them.’”
She got up from the grass.
It was hard on Lucy. Mr. Beebe sympathized with her very much. While
she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from Sir Harry
Otway, she had borne it like a good girl. She might well “screech” when
she heard that it came partly from her lover. Mr. Vyse was a
tease—something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure in
thwarting people. The clergyman, knowing this, looked at Miss
Honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.
When she exclaimed, “But Cecil’s Emersons—they can’t possibly be the
same ones—there is that—” he did not consider that the exclamation was
strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation
while she recovered her composure. He diverted it as follows:
“The Emersons who were at Florence, do you mean? No, I don’t suppose it
will prove to be them. It is probably a long cry from them to friends
of Mr. Vyse’s. Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, the oddest people! The queerest
people! For our part we liked them, didn’t we?” He appealed to Lucy.
“There was a great scene over some violets. They picked violets and
filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have
failed to come to Cissie Villa. Poor little ladies! So shocked and so
pleased. It used to be one of Miss Catharine’s great stories. ‘My dear
sister loves flowers,’ it began. They found the whole room a mass of
blue—vases and jugs—and the story ends with ‘So ungentlemanly and yet
so beautiful.’ It is all very difficult. Yes, I always connect those
Florentine Emersons with violets.”
“Fiasco’s done you this time,” remarked Freddy, not seeing that his
sister’s face was very red. She could not recover herself. Mr. Beebe
saw it, and continued to divert the conversation.
“These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son—the son a
goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, I fancy, but very
immature—pessimism, et cetera. Our special joy was the father—such a
sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.”
In his normal state Mr. Beebe would never have repeated such gossip,
but he was trying to shelter Lucy in her little trouble. He repeated
any rubbish that came into his head.
“Murdered his wife?” said Mrs. Honeychurch. “Lucy, don’t desert us—go
on playing bumble-puppy. Really, the Pension Bertolini must have been
the oddest place. That’s the second murderer I’ve heard of as being
there. Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop? By-the-by, we really must
ask Charlotte here some time.”
Mr. Beebe could recall no second murderer. He suggested that his
hostess was mistaken. At the hint of opposition she warmed. She was
perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same
story had been told. The name escaped her. What was the name? Oh, what
was the name? She clasped her knees for the name. Something in
Thackeray. She struck her matronly forehead.
Lucy asked her brother whether Cecil was in.
“Oh, don’t go!” he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.
“I must go,” she said gravely. “Don’t be silly. You always overdo it
when you play.”
As she left them her mother’s shout of “Harris!” shivered the tranquil
air, and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it
right. Such a senseless lie, too, yet it shattered her nerves and made
her connect these Emersons, friends of Cecil’s, with a pair of
nondescript tourists. Hitherto truth had come to her naturally. She saw
that for the future she must be more vigilant, and be—absolutely
truthful? Well, at all events, she must not tell lies. She hurried up
the garden, still flushed with shame. A word from Cecil would soothe
her, she was sure.
“Cecil!”
“Hullo!” he called, and leant out of the smoking-room window. He seemed
in high spirits. “I was hoping you’d come. I heard you all
bear-gardening, but there’s better fun up here. I, even I, have won a
great victory for the Comic Muse. George Meredith’s right—the cause of
Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same; and I, even I, have
found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa. Don’t be angry! Don’t
be angry! You’ll forgive me when you hear it all.”
He looked very attractive when his face was bright, and he dispelled
her ridiculous forebodings at once.
“I have heard,” she said. “Freddy has told us. Naughty Cecil! I suppose
I must forgive you. Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing!
Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome, and I’d rather have
nice friends of yours. But you oughtn’t to tease one so.”
“Friends of mine?” he laughed. “But, Lucy, the whole joke is to come!
Come here.” But she remained standing where she was. “Do you know where
I met these desirable tenants? In the National Gallery, when I was up
to see my mother last week.”
“What an odd place to meet people!” she said nervously. “I don’t quite
understand.”
“In the Umbrian Room. Absolute strangers. They were admiring Luca
Signorelli—of course, quite stupidly. However, we got talking, and they
refreshed me not a little. They had been to Italy.”
“But, Cecil—” proceeded hilariously.
“In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country
cottage—the father to live there, the son to run down for week-ends. I
thought, ‘What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry!’ and I took their
address and a London reference, found they weren’t actual
blackguards—it was great sport—and wrote to him, making out—”
“Cecil! No, it’s not fair. I’ve probably met them before—”
He bore her down.
“Perfectly fair. Anything is fair that punishes a snob. That old man
will do the neighbourhood a world of good. Sir Harry is too disgusting
with his ‘decayed gentlewomen.’ I meant to read him a lesson some time.
No, Lucy, the classes ought to mix, and before long you’ll agree with
me. There ought to be intermarriage—all sorts of things. I believe in
democracy—”
“No, you don’t,” she snapped. “You don’t know what the word means.”
He stared at her, and felt again that she had failed to be
Leonardesque. “No, you don’t!”
Her face was inartistic—that of a peevish virago.
“It isn’t fair, Cecil. I blame you—I blame you very much indeed. You
had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans, and make me look
ridiculous. You call it scoring off Sir Harry, but do you realize that
it is all at my expense? I consider it most disloyal of you.”
She left him.
“Temper!” he thought, raising his eyebrows.
No, it was worse than temper—snobbishness. As long as Lucy thought that
his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans, she had not
minded. He perceived that these new tenants might be of value
educationally. He would tolerate the father and draw out the son, who
was silent. In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth, he would
bring them to Windy Corner.
Chapter XI
In Mrs. Vyse’s Well-Appointed Flat
The Comic Muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of Mr. Vyse. His idea of bringing the Emersons
to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through
the negotiations without a hitch. Sir Harry Otway signed the agreement,
met Mr. Emerson, who was duly disillusioned. The Miss Alans were duly
offended, and wrote a dignified letter to Lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. Mr. Beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told Mrs. Honeychurch that Freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. Indeed, so ample was the Muse’s equipment that
she permitted Mr. Harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his
head, to be forgotten, and to die.
Lucy—to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows
because there are hills—Lucy was at first plunged into despair, but
settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
Now that she was engaged, the Emersons would scarcely insult her and
were welcome into the neighbourhood. And Cecil was welcome to bring
whom he would into the neighbourhood. Therefore Cecil was welcome to
bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood. But, as I say, this took a
little thinking, and—so illogical are girls—the event remained rather
greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done. She was glad
that a visit to Mrs. Vyse now fell due; the tenants moved into Cissie
Villa while she was safe in the London flat.
“Cecil—Cecil darling,” she whispered the evening she arrived, and crept
into his arms.
Cecil, too, became demonstrative. He saw that the needful fire had been
kindled in Lucy. At last she longed for attention, as a woman should,
and looked up to him because he was a man.
“So you do love me, little thing?” he murmured.
“Oh, Cecil, I do, I do! I don’t know what I should do without you.”
Several days passed. Then she had a letter from Miss Bartlett. A
coolness had sprung up between the two cousins, and they had not
corresponded since they parted in August. The coolness dated from what
Charlotte would call “the flight to Rome,” and in Rome it had increased
amazingly. For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval
world becomes exasperating in the classical. Charlotte, unselfish in
the Forum, would have tried a sweeter temper than Lucy’s, and once, in
the Baths of Caracalla, they had doubted whether they could continue
their tour. Lucy had said she would join the Vyses—Mrs. Vyse was an
acquaintance of her mother, so there was no impropriety in the plan and
Miss Bartlett had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned
suddenly. Finally nothing happened; but the coolness remained, and, for
Lucy, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as
follows. It had been forwarded from Windy Corner.
“TUNBRIDGE WELLS,
“_September_.
“DEAREST LUCIA,
“I have news of you at last! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your
parts, but was not sure whether a call would be welcome. Puncturing her
tire near Summer Street, and it being mended while she sat very
woebegone in that pretty churchyard, she saw to her astonishment, a
door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out. He said his
father had just taken the house. He _said_ he did not know that you
lived in the neighbourhood (?). He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup
of tea. Dear Lucy, I am much worried, and I advise you to make a clean
breast of his past behaviour to your mother, Freddy, and Mr. Vyse, who
will forbid him to enter the house, etc. That was a great misfortune,
and I dare say you have told them already. Mr. Vyse is so sensitive. I
remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome. I am very sorry about
it all, and should not feel easy unless I warned you.
“Believe me,
“Your anxious and loving cousin,
“CHARLOTTE.”
Lucy was much annoyed, and replied as follows:
“BEAUCHAMP MANSIONS, S.W.
“DEAR CHARLOTTE,
“Many thanks for your warning. When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the
mountain, you made me promise not to tell mother, because you said she
would blame you for not being always with me. I have kept that promise,
and cannot possibly tell her now. I have said both to her and Cecil
that I met the Emersons at Florence, and that they are respectable
people—which I _do_ think—and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no
tea was probably that he had none himself. She should have tried at the
Rectory. I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage. You must see that
it would be too absurd. If the Emersons heard I had complained of them,
they would think themselves of importance, which is exactly what they
are not. I like the old father, and look forward to seeing him again.
As for the son, I am sorry for _him_ when we meet, rather than for
myself. They are known to Cecil, who is very well and spoke of you the
other day. We expect to be married in January.
“Miss Lavish cannot have told you much about me, for I am not at Windy
Corner at all, but here. Please do not put ‘Private’ outside your
envelope again. No one opens my letters.
“Yours affectionately,
“L. M. HONEYCHURCH.”
Secrecy has this disadvantage: we lose the sense of proportion; we
cannot tell whether our secret is important or not. Were Lucy and her
cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy Cecil’s life if
he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at? Miss
Bartlett suggested the former. Perhaps she was right. It had become a
great thing now. Left to herself, Lucy would have told her mother and
her lover ingenuously, and it would have remained a little thing.
“Emerson, not Harris”; it was only that a few weeks ago. She tried to
tell Cecil even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady
who had smitten his heart at school. But her body behaved so
ridiculously that she stopped.
She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis
visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on. It did her no
harm, Cecil thought, to learn the framework of society, while society
itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors. The weather was cool,
and it did her no harm. In spite of the season, Mrs. Vyse managed to
scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren
of famous people. The food was poor, but the talk had a witty weariness
that impressed the girl. One was tired of everything, it seemed. One
launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully, and pick oneself
up amid sympathetic laughter. In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini
and Windy Corner appeared equally crude, and Lucy saw that her London
career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the
past.
The grandchildren asked her to play the piano.
She played Schumann. “Now some Beethoven” called Cecil, when the
querulous beauty of the music had died. She shook her head and played
Schumann again. The melody rose, unprofitably magical. It broke; it was
resumed broken, not marching once from the cradle to the grave. The
sadness of the incomplete—the sadness that is often Life, but should
never be Art—throbbed in its disjected phrases, and made the nerves of
the audience throb. Not thus had she played on the little draped piano
at the Bertolini, and “Too much Schumann” was not the remark that Mr.
Beebe had passed to himself when she returned.
When the guests were gone, and Lucy had gone to bed, Mrs. Vyse paced up
and down the drawing-room, discussing her little party with her son.
Mrs. Vyse was a nice woman, but her personality, like many another’s,
had been swamped by London, for it needs a strong head to live among
many people. The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her; and she had
seen too many seasons, too many cities, too many men, for her
abilities, and even with Cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he
was not one son, but, so to speak, a filial crowd.
“Make Lucy one of us,” she said, looking round intelligently at the end
of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
“Lucy is becoming wonderful—wonderful.”
“Her music always was wonderful.”
“Yes, but she is purging off the Honeychurch taint, most excellent
Honeychurches, but you know what I mean. She is not always quoting
servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.”
“Italy has done it.”
“Perhaps,” she murmured, thinking of the museum that represented Italy
to her. “It is just possible. Cecil, mind you marry her next January.
She is one of us already.”
“But her music!” he exclaimed. “The style of her! How she kept to
Schumann when, like an idiot, I wanted Beethoven. Schumann was right
for this evening. Schumann was the thing. Do you know, mother, I shall
have our children educated just like Lucy. Bring them up among honest
country folks for freshness, send them to Italy for subtlety, and
then—not till then—let them come to London. I don’t believe in these
London educations—” He broke off, remembering that he had had one
himself, and concluded, “At all events, not for women.”
“Make her one of us,” repeated Mrs. Vyse, and processed to bed.
As she was dozing off, a cry—the cry of nightmare—rang from Lucy’s
room. Lucy could ring for the maid if she liked but Mrs. Vyse thought
it kind to go herself. She found the girl sitting upright with her hand
on her cheek.
“I am so sorry, Mrs. Vyse—it is these dreams.”
“Bad dreams?”
“Just dreams.”
The elder lady smiled and kissed her, saying very distinctly: “You
should have heard us talking about you, dear. He admires you more than
ever. Dream of that.”
Lucy returned the kiss, still covering one cheek with her hand. Mrs.
Vyse recessed to bed. Cecil, whom the cry had not awoke, snored.
Darkness enveloped the flat.
Chapter XII
Twelfth Chapter
It was a Saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains,
and the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn.
All that was gracious triumphed. As the motorcars passed through Summer
Street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon
dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or
of the pines. Mr. Beebe, at leisure for life’s amenities, leant over
his Rectory gate. Freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.
“Suppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.”
“M’m.”
“They might amuse you.”
Freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new
people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just
moved in.
“I suggested we should hinder them,” said Mr. Beebe. “They are worth
it.” Unlatching the gate, he sauntered over the triangular green to
Cissie Villa. “Hullo!” he cried, shouting in at the open door, through
which much squalor was visible.
A grave voice replied, “Hullo!”
“I’ve brought someone to see you.”
“I’ll be down in a minute.”
The passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed
to carry up the stairs. Mr. Beebe edged round it with difficulty. The
sitting-room itself was blocked with books.
“Are these people great readers?” Freddy whispered. “Are they that
sort?”
“I fancy they know how to read—a rare accomplishment. What have they
got? Byron. Exactly. A Shropshire Lad. Never heard of it. The Way of
All Flesh. Never heard of it. Gibbon. Hullo! dear George reads German.
Um—um—Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and so we go on. Well, I suppose your
generation knows its own business, Honeychurch.”
“Mr. Beebe, look at that,” said Freddy in awestruck tones.
On the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this
inscription: “Mistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.”
“I know. Isn’t it jolly? I like that. I’m certain that’s the old man’s
doing.”
“How very odd of him!”
“Surely you agree?”
But Freddy was his mother’s son and felt that one ought not to go on
spoiling the furniture.
“Pictures!” the clergyman continued, scrambling about the room.
“Giotto—they got that at Florence, I’ll be bound.”
“The same as Lucy’s got.”
“Oh, by-the-by, did Miss Honeychurch enjoy London?”
“She came back yesterday.”
“I suppose she had a good time?”
“Yes, very,” said Freddy, taking up a book. “She and Cecil are thicker
than ever.”
“That’s good hearing.”
“I wish I wasn’t such a fool, Mr. Beebe.”
Mr. Beebe ignored the remark.
“Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am, but it’ll be very different
now, mother thinks. She will read all kinds of books.”
“So will you.”
“Only medical books. Not books that you can talk about afterwards.
Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian, and he says her playing is wonderful.
There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed. Cecil
says—”
“What on earth are those people doing upstairs? Emerson—we think we’ll
come another time.”
George ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, a neighbour.”
Then Freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. Perhaps he was
shy, perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that George’s face
wanted washing. At all events he greeted him with, “How d’ye do? Come
and have a bathe.”
“Oh, all right,” said George, impassive.
Mr. Beebe was highly entertained.
“‘How d’ye do? how d’ye do? Come and have a bathe,’” he chuckled.
“That’s the best conversational opening I’ve ever heard. But I’m afraid
it will only act between men. Can you picture a lady who has been
introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ‘How
do you do? Come and have a bathe’? And yet you will tell me that the
sexes are equal.”
“I tell you that they shall be,” said Mr. Emerson, who had been slowly
descending the stairs. “Good afternoon, Mr. Beebe. I tell you they
shall be comrades, and George thinks the same.”
“We are to raise ladies to our level?” the clergyman inquired.
“The Garden of Eden,” pursued Mr. Emerson, still descending, “which you
place in the past, is really yet to come. We shall enter it when we no
longer despise our bodies.”
Mr. Beebe disclaimed placing the Garden of Eden anywhere.
“In this—not in other things—we men are ahead. We despise the body less
than women do. But not until we are comrades shall we enter the
garden.”
“I say, what about this bathe?” murmured Freddy, appalled at the mass
of philosophy that was approaching him.
“I believed in a return to Nature once. But how can we return to Nature
when we have never been with her? To-day, I believe that we must
discover Nature. After many conquests we shall attain simplicity. It is
our heritage.”
“Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch, whose sister you will remember at
Florence.”
“How do you do? Very glad to see you, and that you are taking George
for a bathe. Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry.
Marriage is a duty. I am sure that she will be happy, for we know Mr.
Vyse, too. He has been most kind. He met us by chance in the National
Gallery, and arranged everything about this delightful house. Though I
hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway. I have met so few Liberal
landowners, and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game
laws with the Conservative attitude. Ah, this wind! You do well to
bathe. Yours is a glorious country, Honeychurch!”
“Not a bit!” mumbled Freddy. “I must—that is to say, I have to—have the
pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, I hope.”
“_Call_, my lad? Who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? Call on your
grandmother! Listen to the wind among the pines! Yours is a glorious
country.”
Mr. Beebe came to the rescue.
“Mr. Emerson, he will call, I shall call; you or your son will return
our calls before ten days have elapsed. I trust that you have realized
about the ten days’ interval. It does not count that I helped you with
the stair-eyes yesterday. It does not count that they are going to
bathe this afternoon.”
“Yes, go and bathe, George. Why do you dawdle talking? Bring them back
to tea. Bring back some milk, cakes, honey. The change will do you
good. George has been working very hard at his office. I can’t believe
he’s well.”
George bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of
one who has handled furniture.
“Do you really want this bathe?” Freddy asked him. “It is only a pond,
don’t you know. I dare say you are used to something better.”
“Yes—I have said ‘Yes’ already.”
Mr. Beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out of
the house and into the pine-woods. How glorious it was! For a little
time the voice of old Mr. Emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes
and philosophy. It ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing
the bracken and the trees. Mr. Beebe, who could be silent, but who
could not bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition
looked like a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a
word. He spoke of Florence. George attended gravely, assenting or
dissenting with slight but determined gestures that were as
inexplicable as the motions of the tree-tops above their heads.
“And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse! Did you realize
that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here?”
“I did not. Miss Lavish told me.”
“When I was a young man, I always meant to write a ‘History of
Coincidence.’”
No enthusiasm.
“Though, as a matter of fact, coincidences are much rarer than we
suppose. For example, it isn’t purely coincidentally that you are here
now, when one comes to reflect.”
To his relief, George began to talk.
“It is. I have reflected. It is Fate. Everything is Fate. We are flung
together by Fate, drawn apart by Fate—flung together, drawn apart. The
twelve winds blow us—we settle nothing—”
“You have not reflected at all,” rapped the clergyman. “Let me give you
a useful tip, Emerson: attribute nothing to Fate. Don’t say, ‘I didn’t
do this,’ for you did it, ten to one. Now I’ll cross-question you.
Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself?”
“Italy.”
“And where did you meet Mr. Vyse, who is going to marry Miss
Honeychurch?”
“National Gallery.”
“Looking at Italian art. There you are, and yet you talk of coincidence
and Fate. You naturally seek out things Italian, and so do we and our
friends. This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.”
“It is Fate that I am here,” persisted George. “But you can call it
Italy if it makes you less unhappy.”
Mr. Beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. But he
was infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub George.
“And so for this and for other reasons my ‘History of Coincidence’ is
still to write.”
Silence.
Wishing to round off the episode, he added; “We are all so glad that
you have come.”
Silence.
“Here we are!” called Freddy.
“Oh, good!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe, mopping his brow.
“In there’s the pond. I wish it was bigger,” he added apologetically.
They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. There lay the pond,
set in its little alp of green—only a pond, but large enough to contain
the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. On account of the
rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like
a beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.
“It’s distinctly successful, as ponds go,” said Mr. Beebe. “No
apologies are necessary for the pond.”
George sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his
boots.
“Aren’t those masses of willow-herb splendid? I love willow-herb in
seed. What’s the name of this aromatic plant?”
No one knew, or seemed to care.
“These abrupt changes of vegetation—this little spongeous tract of
water plants, and on either side of it all the growths are tough or
brittle—heather, bracken, hurts, pines. Very charming, very charming.”
“Mr. Beebe, aren’t you bathing?” called Freddy, as he stripped himself.
Mr. Beebe thought he was not.
“Water’s wonderful!” cried Freddy, prancing in.
“Water’s water,” murmured George. Wetting his hair first—a sure sign of
apathy—he followed Freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were
a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. It was necessary to use his
muscles. It was necessary to keep clean. Mr. Beebe watched them, and
watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their
heads.
“Apooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,” went Freddy, swimming for two strokes
in either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.
“Is it worth it?” asked the other, Michelangelesque on the flooded
margin.
The bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed
the question properly.
“Hee-poof—I’ve swallowed a pollywog, Mr. Beebe, water’s wonderful,
water’s simply ripping.”
“Water’s not so bad,” said George, reappearing from his plunge, and
sputtering at the sun.
“Water’s wonderful. Mr. Beebe, do.”
“Apooshoo, kouf.”
Mr. Beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible,
looked around him. He could detect no parishioners except the
pine-trees, rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other
against the blue. How glorious it was! The world of motor-cars and
rural Deans receded inimitably. Water, sky, evergreens, a wind—these
things not even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the
intrusion of man?
“I may as well wash too”; and soon his garments made a third little
pile on the sward, and he too asserted the wonder of the water.
It was ordinary water, nor was there very much of it, and, as Freddy
said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. The three gentlemen
rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in
Götterdämmerung. But either because the rains had given a freshness or
because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of
the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit—for
some reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot Italy and
Botany and Fate. They began to play. Mr. Beebe and Freddy splashed each
other. A little deferentially, they splashed George. He was quiet: they
feared they had offended him. Then all the forces of youth burst out.
He smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked
them, muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.
“Race you round it, then,” cried Freddy, and they raced in the
sunshine, and George took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to
bathe a second time. Then Mr. Beebe consented to run—a memorable sight.
They ran to get dry, they bathed to get cool, they played at being
Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken, they bathed to get
clean. And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the
sward, proclaiming:
“No. We are what matters. Without us shall no enterprise begin. To us
shall all flesh turn in the end.”
“A try! A try!” yelled Freddy, snatching up George’s bundle and placing
it beside an imaginary goal-post.
“Socker rules,” George retorted, scattering Freddy’s bundle with a
kick.
“Goal!”
“Goal!”
“Pass!”
“Take care my watch!” cried Mr. Beebe.
Clothes flew in all directions.
“Take care my hat! No, that’s enough, Freddy. Dress now. No, I say!”
But the two young men were delirious. Away they twinkled into the
trees, Freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, George with a
wide-awake hat on his dripping hair.
“That’ll do!” shouted Mr. Beebe, remembering that after all he was in
his own parish. Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a
Rural Dean. “Hi! Steady on! I see people coming you fellows!”
Yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.
“Hi! hi! _Ladies!_”
Neither George nor Freddy was truly refined. Still, they did not hear
Mr. Beebe’s last warning or they would have avoided Mrs. Honeychurch,
Cecil, and Lucy, who were walking down to call on old Mrs. Butterworth.
Freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some
bracken. George whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down
the path to the pond, still clad in Mr. Beebe’s hat.
“Gracious alive!” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. “Whoever were those
unfortunate people? Oh, dears, look away! And poor Mr. Beebe, too!
Whatever has happened?”
“Come this way immediately,” commanded Cecil, who always felt that he
must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though
he knew not against what. He led them now towards the bracken where
Freddy sat concealed.
“Oh, poor Mr. Beebe! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path? Cecil,
Mr. Beebe’s waistcoat—”
No business of ours, said Cecil, glancing at Lucy, who was all parasol
and evidently “minded.”
“I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond.”
“This way, please, Mrs. Honeychurch, this way.”
They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant
expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.
“Well, _I_ can’t help it,” said a voice close ahead, and Freddy reared
a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds. “I
can’t be trodden on, can I?”
“Good gracious me, dear; so it’s you! What miserable management! Why
not have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?”
“Look here, mother, a fellow must wash, and a fellow’s got to dry, and
if another fellow—”
“Dear, no doubt you’re right as usual, but you are in no position to
argue. Come, Lucy.” They turned. “Oh, look—don’t look! Oh, poor Mr.
Beebe! How unfortunate again—”
For Mr. Beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface
garments of an intimate nature did float; while George, the world-weary
George, shouted to Freddy that he had hooked a fish.
“And me, I’ve swallowed one,” answered he of the bracken. “I’ve
swallowed a pollywog. It wriggleth in my tummy. I shall die—Emerson you
beast, you’ve got on my bags.”
“Hush, dears,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain
shocked. “And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. All these
colds come of not drying thoroughly.”
“Mother, do come away,” said Lucy. “Oh for goodness’ sake, do come.”
“Hullo!” cried George, so that again the ladies stopped.
He regarded himself as dressed. Barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and
personable against the shadowy woods, he called:
“Hullo, Miss Honeychurch! Hullo!”
“Bow, Lucy; better bow. Whoever is it? I shall bow.”
Miss Honeychurch bowed.
That evening and all that night the water ran away. On the morrow the
pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. It had been a call
to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose
influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for
youth.
Chapter XIII
How Miss Bartlett’s Boiler Was So Tiresome
How often had Lucy rehearsed this bow, this interview! But she had
always rehearsed them indoors, and with certain accessories, which
surely we have a right to assume. Who could foretell that she and
George would meet in the rout of a civilization, amidst an army of
coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth? She
had imagined a young Mr. Emerson, who might be shy or morbid or
indifferent or furtively impudent. She was prepared for all of these.
But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with
the shout of the morning star.
Indoors herself, partaking of tea with old Mrs. Butterworth, she
reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree
of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the
scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the
stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too
much. “I will bow,” she had thought. “I will not shake hands with him.
That will be just the proper thing.” She had bowed—but to whom? To
gods, to heroes, to the nonsense of school-girls! She had bowed across
the rubbish that cumbers the world.
So ran her thoughts, while her faculties were busy with Cecil. It was
another of those dreadful engagement calls. Mrs. Butterworth had wanted
to see him, and he did not want to be seen. He did not want to hear
about hydrangeas, why they change their colour at the seaside. He did
not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate, and
made long, clever answers where “Yes” or “No” would have done. Lucy
soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised
well for their married peace. No one is perfect, and surely it is wiser
to discover the imperfections before wedlock. Miss Bartlett, indeed,
though not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains
nothing satisfactory. Lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded
the teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.
“Lucy,” said her mother, when they got home, “is anything the matter
with Cecil?”
The question was ominous; up till now Mrs. Honeychurch had behaved with
charity and restraint.
“No, I don’t think so, mother; Cecil’s all right.”
“Perhaps he’s tired.”
Lucy compromised: perhaps Cecil was a little tired.
“Because otherwise”—she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering
displeasure—“because otherwise I cannot account for him.”
“I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.”
“Cecil has told you to think so. You were devoted to her as a little
girl, and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid
fever. No—it is just the same thing everywhere.”
“Let me just put your bonnet away, may I?”
“Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour?”
“Cecil has a very high standard for people,” faltered Lucy, seeing
trouble ahead. “It’s part of his ideals—it is really that that makes
him sometimes seem—”
“Oh, rubbish! If high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets
rid of them the better,” said Mrs. Honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.
“Now, mother! I’ve seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself!”
“Not in that way. At times I could wring her neck. But not in that way.
No. It is the same with Cecil all over.”
“By-the-by—I never told you. I had a letter from Charlotte while I was
away in London.”
This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and Mrs.
Honeychurch resented it.
“Since Cecil came back from London, nothing appears to please him.
Whenever I speak he winces;—I see him, Lucy; it is useless to
contradict me. No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor
intellectual nor musical, but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture;
your father bought it and we must put up with it, will Cecil kindly
remember.”
“I—I see what you mean, and certainly Cecil oughtn’t to. But he does
not mean to be uncivil—he once explained—it is the _things_ that upset
him—he is easily upset by ugly things—he is not uncivil to _people_.”
“Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings?”
“You can’t expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we
do.”
“Then why didn’t he leave the room? Why sit wriggling and sneering and
spoiling everyone’s pleasure?”
“We mustn’t be unjust to people,” faltered Lucy. Something had
enfeebled her, and the case for Cecil, which she had mastered so
perfectly in London, would not come forth in an effective form. The two
civilizations had clashed—Cecil hinted that they might—and she was
dazzled and bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all
civilization had blinded her eyes. Good taste and bad taste were only
catchwords, garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a
whisper through pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from
the comic song.
She remained in much embarrassment, while Mrs. Honeychurch changed her
frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made
things no better. There was no concealing the fact, Cecil had meant to
be supercilious, and he had succeeded. And Lucy—she knew not why—wished
that the trouble could have come at any other time.
“Go and dress, dear; you’ll be late.”
“All right, mother—”
“Don’t say ‘All right’ and stop. Go.”
She obeyed, but loitered disconsolately at the landing window. It faced
north, so there was little view, and no view of the sky. Now, as in the
winter, the pine-trees hung close to her eyes. One connected the
landing window with depression. No definite problem menaced her, but
she sighed to herself, “Oh, dear, what shall I do, what shall I do?” It
seemed to her that everyone else was behaving very badly. And she ought
not to have mentioned Miss Bartlett’s letter. She must be more careful;
her mother was rather inquisitive, and might have asked what it was
about. Oh, dear, what should she do?—and then Freddy came bounding
upstairs, and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved.
“I say, those are topping people.”
“My dear baby, how tiresome you’ve been! You have no business to take
them bathing in the Sacred Lake; it’s much too public. It was all right
for you but most awkward for everyone else. Do be more careful. You
forget the place is growing half suburban.”
“I say, is anything on to-morrow week?”
“Not that I know of.”
“Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis.”
“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, Freddy, I wouldn’t do that with all this
muddle.”
“What’s wrong with the court? They won’t mind a bump or two, and I’ve
ordered new balls.”
“I meant _it’s_ better not. I really mean it.”
He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the
passage. She pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with
temper. Cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they
impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans. Then Mrs. Honeychurch
opened her door and said: “Lucy, what a noise you’re making! I have
something to say to you. Did you say you had had a letter from
Charlotte?” and Freddy ran away.
“Yes. I really can’t stop. I must dress too.”
“How’s Charlotte?”
“All right.”
“Lucy!”
The unfortunate girl returned.
“You’ve a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one’s sentences.
Did Charlotte mention her boiler?”
“Her _what?_”
“Don’t you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October, and
her bath cistern cleaned out, and all kinds of terrible to-doings?”
“I can’t remember all Charlotte’s worries,” said Lucy bitterly. “I
shall have enough of my own, now that you are not pleased with Cecil.”
Mrs. Honeychurch might have flamed out. She did not. She said: “Come
here, old lady—thank you for putting away my bonnet—kiss me.” And,
though nothing is perfect, Lucy felt for the moment that her mother and
Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect.
So the grittiness went out of life. It generally did at Windy Corner.
At the last minute, when the social machine was clogged hopelessly, one
member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil. Cecil despised
their methods—perhaps rightly. At all events, they were not his own.
Dinner was at half-past seven. Freddy gabbled the grace, and they drew
up their heavy chairs and fell to. Fortunately, the men were hungry.
Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding. Then Freddy said:
“Lucy, what’s Emerson like?”
“I saw him in Florence,” said Lucy, hoping that this would pass for a
reply.
“Is he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?”
“Ask Cecil; it is Cecil who brought him here.”
“He is the clever sort, like myself,” said Cecil.
Freddy looked at him doubtfully.
“How well did you know them at the Bertolini?” asked Mrs. Honeychurch.
“Oh, very slightly. I mean, Charlotte knew them even less than I did.”
“Oh, that reminds me—you never told me what Charlotte said in her
letter.”
“One thing and another,” said Lucy, wondering whether she would get
through the meal without a lie. “Among other things, that an awful
friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street, wondered if
she’d come up and see us, and mercifully didn’t.”
“Lucy, I do call the way you talk unkind.”
“She was a novelist,” said Lucy craftily. The remark was a happy one,
for nothing roused Mrs. Honeychurch so much as literature in the hands
of females. She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those
women who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek
notoriety by print. Her attitude was: “If books must be written, let
them be written by men”; and she developed it at great length, while
Cecil yawned and Freddy played at “This year, next year, now, never,”
with his plum-stones, and Lucy artfully fed the flames of her mother’s
wrath. But soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to
gather in the darkness. There were too many ghosts about. The original
ghost—that touch of lips on her cheek—had surely been laid long ago; it
could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once.
But it had begotten a spectral family—Mr. Harris, Miss Bartlett’s
letter, Mr. Beebe’s memories of violets—and one or other of these was
bound to haunt her before Cecil’s very eyes. It was Miss Bartlett who
returned now, and with appalling vividness.
“I have been thinking, Lucy, of that letter of Charlotte’s. How is
she?”
“I tore the thing up.”
“Didn’t she say how she was? How does she sound? Cheerful?”
“Oh, yes I suppose so—no—not very cheerful, I suppose.”
“Then, depend upon it, it _is_ the boiler. I know myself how water
preys upon one’s mind. I would rather anything else—even a misfortune
with the meat.”
Cecil laid his hand over his eyes.
“So would I,” asserted Freddy, backing his mother up—backing up the
spirit of her remark rather than the substance.
“And I have been thinking,” she added rather nervously, “surely we
could squeeze Charlotte in here next week, and give her a nice holiday
while the plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish. I have not seen poor
Charlotte for so long.”
It was more than her nerves could stand. And she could not protest
violently after her mother’s goodness to her upstairs.
“Mother, no!” she pleaded. “It’s impossible. We can’t have Charlotte on
the top of the other things; we’re squeezed to death as it is. Freddy’s
got a friend coming Tuesday, there’s Cecil, and you’ve promised to take
in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare. It simply can’t be
done.”
“Nonsense! It can.”
“If Minnie sleeps in the bath. Not otherwise.”
“Minnie can sleep with you.”
“I won’t have her.”
“Then, if you’re so selfish, Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy.”
“Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett, Miss Bartlett,” moaned Cecil, again
laying his hand over his eyes.
“It’s impossible,” repeated Lucy. “I don’t want to make difficulties,
but it really isn’t fair on the maids to fill up the house so.”
Alas!
“The truth is, dear, you don’t like Charlotte.”
“No, I don’t. And no more does Cecil. She gets on our nerves. You
haven’t seen her lately, and don’t realize how tiresome she can be,
though so good. So please, mother, don’t worry us this last summer; but
spoil us by not asking her to come.”
“Hear, hear!” said Cecil.
Mrs. Honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling
than she usually permitted herself, replied: “This isn’t very kind of
you two. You have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of
beautiful things; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and
plumbers. You are young, dears, and however clever young people are,
and however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels
like to grow old.”
Cecil crumbled his bread.
“I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on
my bike,” put in Freddy. “She thanked me for coming till I felt like
such a fool, and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea
just right.”
“I know, dear. She is kind to everyone, and yet Lucy makes this
difficulty when we try to give her some little return.”
But Lucy hardened her heart. It was no good being kind to Miss
Bartlett. She had tried herself too often and too recently. One might
lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt, but one enriched neither Miss
Bartlett nor any one else upon earth. She was reduced to saying: “I
can’t help it, mother. I don’t like Charlotte. I admit it’s horrid of
me.”
“From your own account, you told her as much.”
“Well, she would leave Florence so stupidly. She flurried—”
The ghosts were returning; they filled Italy, they were even usurping
the places she had known as a child. The Sacred Lake would never be the
same again, and, on Sunday week, something would even happen to Windy
Corner. How would she fight against ghosts? For a moment the visible
world faded away, and memories and emotions alone seemed real.
“I suppose Miss Bartlett must come, since she boils eggs so well,” said
Cecil, who was in rather a happier frame of mind, thanks to the
admirable cooking.
“I didn’t mean the egg was _well_ boiled,” corrected Freddy, “because
in point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact I
don’t care for eggs. I only meant how jolly kind she seemed.”
Cecil frowned again. Oh, these Honeychurches! Eggs, boilers,
hydrangeas, maids—of such were their lives compact. “May me and Lucy
get down from our chairs?” he asked, with scarcely veiled insolence.
“We don’t want no dessert.”
Chapter XIV
How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely
Of course Miss Bartlett accepted. And, equally of course, she felt sure
that she would prove a nuisance, and begged to be given an inferior
spare room—something with no view, anything. Her love to Lucy. And,
equally of course, George Emerson could come to tennis on the Sunday
week.
Lucy faced the situation bravely, though, like most of us, she only
faced the situation that encompassed her. She never gazed inwards. If
at times strange images rose from the depths, she put them down to
nerves. When Cecil brought the Emersons to Summer Street, it had upset
her nerves. Charlotte would burnish up past foolishness, and this might
upset her nerves. She was nervous at night. When she talked to
George—they met again almost immediately at the Rectory—his voice moved
her deeply, and she wished to remain near him. How dreadful if she
really wished to remain near him! Of course, the wish was due to
nerves, which love to play such perverse tricks upon us. Once she had
suffered from “things that came out of nothing and meant she didn’t
know what.” Now Cecil had explained psychology to her one wet
afternoon, and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be
dismissed.
It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude, “She loves young
Emerson.” A reader in Lucy’s place would not find it obvious. Life is
easy to chronicle, but bewildering to practice, and we welcome “nerves”
or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire. She loved
Cecil; George made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the
phrases should have been reversed?
But the external situation—she will face that bravely.
The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough. Standing between
Mr. Beebe and Cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy,
and George had replied. She was anxious to show that she was not shy,
and was glad that he did not seem shy either.
“A nice fellow,” said Mr. Beebe afterwards “He will work off his
crudities in time. I rather mistrust young men who slip into life
gracefully.”
Lucy said, “He seems in better spirits. He laughs more.”
“Yes,” replied the clergyman. “He is waking up.”
That was all. But, as the week wore on, more of her defences fell, and
she entertained an image that had physical beauty. In spite of the
clearest directions, Miss Bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival. She
was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking, whither Mrs.
Honeychurch drove to meet her. She arrived at the London and Brighton
station, and had to hire a cab up. No one was at home except Freddy and
his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a
solid hour. Cecil and Lucy turned up at four o’clock, and these, with
little Minnie Beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper
lawn for tea.
“I shall never forgive myself,” said Miss Bartlett, who kept on rising
from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain. “I
have upset everything. Bursting in on young people! But I insist on
paying for my cab up. Grant that, at any rate.”
“Our visitors never do such dreadful things,” said Lucy, while her
brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown
unsubstantial, exclaimed in irritable tones: “Just what I’ve been
trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of, Lucy, for the last half hour.”
“I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor,” said Miss Bartlett, and
looked at her frayed glove.
“All right, if you’d really rather. Five shillings, and I gave a bob to
the driver.”
Miss Bartlett looked in her purse. Only sovereigns and pennies. Could
any one give her change? Freddy had half a quid and his friend had four
half-crowns. Miss Bartlett accepted their moneys and then said: “But
who am I to give the sovereign to?”
“Let’s leave it all till mother comes back,” suggested Lucy.
“No, dear; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not
hampered with me. We all have our little foibles, and mine is the
prompt settling of accounts.”
Here Freddy’s friend, Mr. Floyd, made the one remark of his that need
be quoted: he offered to toss Freddy for Miss Bartlett’s quid. A
solution seemed in sight, and even Cecil, who had been ostentatiously
drinking his tea at the view, felt the eternal attraction of Chance,
and turned round.
But this did not do, either.
“Please—please—I know I am a sad spoil-sport, but it would make me
wretched. I should practically be robbing the one who lost.”
“Freddy owes me fifteen shillings,” interposed Cecil. “So it will work
out right if you give the pound to me.”
“Fifteen shillings,” said Miss Bartlett dubiously. “How is that, Mr.
Vyse?”
“Because, don’t you see, Freddy paid your cab. Give me the pound, and
we shall avoid this deplorable gambling.”
Miss Bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered
up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths.
For a moment Cecil was happy. He was playing at nonsense among his
peers. Then he glanced at Lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had
marred the smiles. In January he would rescue his Leonardo from this
stupefying twaddle.
“But I don’t see that!” exclaimed Minnie Beebe who had narrowly watched
the iniquitous transaction. “I don’t see why Mr. Vyse is to have the
quid.”
“Because of the fifteen shillings and the five,” they said solemnly.
“Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.”
“But I don’t see—”
They tried to stifle her with cake.
“No, thank you. I’m done. I don’t see why—Freddy, don’t poke me. Miss
Honeychurch, your brother’s hurting me. Ow! What about Mr. Floyd’s ten
shillings? Ow! No, I don’t see and I never shall see why Miss
What’s-her-name shouldn’t pay that bob for the driver.”
“I had forgotten the driver,” said Miss Bartlett, reddening. “Thank
you, dear, for reminding me. A shilling was it? Can any one give me
change for half a crown?”
“I’ll get it,” said the young hostess, rising with decision.
“Cecil, give me that sovereign. No, give me up that sovereign. I’ll get
Euphemia to change it, and we’ll start the whole thing again from the
beginning.”
“Lucy—Lucy—what a nuisance I am!” protested Miss Bartlett, and followed
her across the lawn. Lucy tripped ahead, simulating hilarity. When they
were out of earshot Miss Bartlett stopped her wails and said quite
briskly: “Have you told him about him yet?”
“No, I haven’t,” replied Lucy, and then could have bitten her tongue
for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant. “Let me see—a
sovereign’s worth of silver.”
She escaped into the kitchen. Miss Bartlett’s sudden transitions were
too uncanny. It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke
or caused to be spoken; as if all this worry about cabs and change had
been a ruse to surprise the soul.
“No, I haven’t told Cecil or any one,” she remarked, when she returned.
“I promised you I shouldn’t. Here is your money—all shillings, except
two half-crowns. Would you count it? You can settle your debt nicely
now.”
Miss Bartlett was in the drawing-room, gazing at the photograph of St.
John ascending, which had been framed.
“How dreadful!” she murmured, “how more than dreadful, if Mr. Vyse
should come to hear of it from some other source.”
“Oh, no, Charlotte,” said the girl, entering the battle. “George
Emerson is all right, and what other source is there?”
Miss Bartlett considered. “For instance, the driver. I saw him looking
through the bushes at you, remember he had a violet between his teeth.”
Lucy shuddered a little. “We shall get the silly affair on our nerves
if we aren’t careful. How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold
of Cecil?”
“We must think of every possibility.”
“Oh, it’s all right.”
“Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows. In fact, he is certain to know.”
“I don’t care if he does. I was grateful to you for your letter, but
even if the news does get round, I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at
it.”
“To contradict it?”
“No, to laugh at it.” But she knew in her heart that she could not
trust him, for he desired her untouched.
“Very well, dear, you know best. Perhaps gentlemen are different to
what they were when I was young. Ladies are certainly different.”
“Now, Charlotte!” She struck at her playfully. “You kind, anxious
thing. What _would_ you have me do? First you say ‘Don’t tell’; and
then you say, ‘Tell’. Which is it to be? Quick!”
Miss Bartlett sighed “I am no match for you in conversation, dearest. I
blush when I think how I interfered at Florence, and you so well able
to look after yourself, and so much cleverer in all ways than I am. You
will never forgive me.”
“Shall we go out, then. They will smash all the china if we don’t.”
For the air rang with the shrieks of Minnie, who was being scalped with
a teaspoon.
“Dear, one moment—we may not have this chance for a chat again. Have
you seen the young one yet?”
“Yes, I have.”
“What happened?”
“We met at the Rectory.”
“What line is he taking up?”
“No line. He talked about Italy, like any other person. It is really
all right. What advantage would he get from being a cad, to put it
bluntly? I do wish I could make you see it my way. He really won’t be
any nuisance, Charlotte.”
“Once a cad, always a cad. That is my poor opinion.”
Lucy paused. “Cecil said one day—and I thought it so profound—that
there are two kinds of cads—the conscious and the subconscious.” She
paused again, to be sure of doing justice to Cecil’s profundity.
Through the window she saw Cecil himself, turning over the pages of a
novel. It was a new one from Smith’s library. Her mother must have
returned from the station.
“Once a cad, always a cad,” droned Miss Bartlett.
“What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head. I fell into
all those violets, and he was silly and surprised. I don’t think we
ought to blame him very much. It makes such a difference when you see a
person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly. It really does;
it makes an enormous difference, and he lost his head: he doesn’t
admire me, or any of that nonsense, one straw. Freddy rather likes him,
and has asked him up here on Sunday, so you can judge for yourself. He
has improved; he doesn’t always look as if he’s going to burst into
tears. He is a clerk in the General Manager’s office at one of the big
railways—not a porter! and runs down to his father for week-ends. Papa
was to do with journalism, but is rheumatic and has retired. There! Now
for the garden.” She took hold of her guest by the arm. “Suppose we
don’t talk about this silly Italian business any more. We want you to
have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner, with no worriting.”
Lucy thought this rather a good speech. The reader may have detected an
unfortunate slip in it. Whether Miss Bartlett detected the slip one
cannot say, for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly
people. She might have spoken further, but they were interrupted by the
entrance of her hostess. Explanations took place, and in the midst of
them Lucy escaped, the images throbbing a little more vividly in her
brain.
Chapter XV
The Disaster Within
The Sunday after Miss Bartlett’s arrival was a glorious day, like most
of the days of that year. In the Weald, autumn approached, breaking up
the green monotony of summer, touching the parks with the grey bloom of
mist, the beech-trees with russet, the oak-trees with gold. Up on the
heights, battalions of black pines witnessed the change, themselves
unchangeable. Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky, and in
either arose the tinkle of church bells.
The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book, which
lay sunning itself upon the gravel path. From the house came incoherent
sounds, as of females preparing for worship. “The men say they won’t
go”—“Well, I don’t blame them”—Minnie says, “need she go?”—“Tell her,
no nonsense”—“Anne! Mary! Hook me behind!”—“Dearest Lucia, may I
trespass upon you for a pin?” For Miss Bartlett had announced that she
at all events was one for church.
The sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by Phaethon, but by
Apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. Its rays fell on the ladies
whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on Mr. Beebe down
at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine Alan;
on George Emerson cleaning his father’s boots; and lastly, to complete
the catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned
previously. The ladies move, Mr. Beebe moves, George moves, and
movement may engender shadow. But this book lies motionless, to be
caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly,
as though acknowledging the caress.
Presently Lucy steps out of the drawing-room window. Her new cerise
dress has been a failure, and makes her look tawdry and wan. At her
throat is a garnet brooch, on her finger a ring set with rubies—an
engagement ring. Her eyes are bent to the Weald. She frowns a
little—not in anger, but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not
to cry. In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her, and she may
frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo
and the western hills.
“Lucy! Lucy! What’s that book? Who’s been taking a book out of the
shelf and leaving it about to spoil?”
“It’s only the library book that Cecil’s been reading.”
“But pick it up, and don’t stand idling there like a flamingo.”
Lucy picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly, Under a
Loggia. She no longer read novels herself, devoting all her spare time
to solid literature in the hope of catching Cecil up. It was dreadful
how little she knew, and even when she thought she knew a thing, like
the Italian painters, she found she had forgotten it. Only this morning
she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca, and
Cecil had said, “What! you aren’t forgetting your Italy already?” And
this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view
and the dear garden in the foreground, and above them, scarcely
conceivable elsewhere, the dear sun.
“Lucy—have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself?”
She hastened in to her mother, who was rapidly working herself into a
Sunday fluster.
“It’s a special collection—I forget what for. I do beg, no vulgar
clinking in the plate with halfpennies; see that Minnie has a nice
bright sixpence. Where is the child? Minnie! That book’s all warped.
(Gracious, how plain you look!) Put it under the Atlas to press.
Minnie!”
“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch—” from the upper regions.
“Minnie, don’t be late. Here comes the horse”—it was always the horse,
never the carriage. “Where’s Charlotte? Run up and hurry her. Why is
she so long? She had nothing to do. She never brings anything but
blouses. Poor Charlotte—How I do detest blouses! Minnie!”
Paganism is infectious—more infectious than diphtheria or piety—and the
Rector’s niece was taken to church protesting. As usual, she didn’t see
why. Why shouldn’t she sit in the sun with the young men? The young
men, who had now appeared, mocked her with ungenerous words. Mrs.
Honeychurch defended orthodoxy, and in the midst of the confusion Miss
Bartlett, dressed in the very height of the fashion, came strolling
down the stairs.
“Dear Marian, I am very sorry, but I have no small change—nothing but
sovereigns and half crowns. Could any one give me—”
“Yes, easily. Jump in. Gracious me, how smart you look! What a lovely
frock! You put us all to shame.”
“If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now, when should I wear
them?” said Miss Bartlett reproachfully. She got into the victoria and
placed herself with her back to the horse. The necessary roar ensued,
and then they drove off.
“Good-bye! Be good!” called out Cecil.
Lucy bit her lip, for the tone was sneering. On the subject of “church
and so on” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation. He had
said that people ought to overhaul themselves, and she did not want to
overhaul herself; she did not know it was done. Honest orthodoxy Cecil
respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a
spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that
might grow heavenward like flowers. All that he said on this subject
pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the
Emersons were different.
She saw the Emersons after church. There was a line of carriages down
the road, and the Honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie
Villa. To save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father
and son smoking in the garden.
“Introduce me,” said her mother. “Unless the young man considers that
he knows me already.”
He probably did; but Lucy ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them
formally. Old Mr. Emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how
glad he was that she was going to be married. She said yes, she was
glad too; and then, as Miss Bartlett and Minnie were lingering behind
with Mr. Beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic,
and asked him how he liked his new house.
“Very much,” he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;
she had never known him offended before. He added: “We find, though,
that the Miss Alans were coming, and that we have turned them out.
Women mind such a thing. I am very much upset about it.”
“I believe that there was some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Honeychurch
uneasily.
“Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,”
said George, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. “He
thought we should be artistic. He is disappointed.”
“And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to
give it up. What do you think?” He appealed to Lucy.
“Oh, stop now you have come,” said Lucy lightly. She must avoid
censuring Cecil. For it was on Cecil that the little episode turned,
though his name was never mentioned.
“So George says. He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall. Yet
it does seem so unkind.”
“There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,” said George,
watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.
“Yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Honeychurch. “That’s exactly what I say. Why all
this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans?”
“There is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain
amount of light,” he continued in measured tones. “We cast a shadow on
something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to
place to save things; because the shadow always follows. Choose a place
where you won’t do harm—yes, choose a place where you won’t do very
much harm, and stand in it for all you are worth, facing the sunshine.”
“Oh, Mr. Emerson, I see you’re clever!”
“Eh—?”
“I see you’re going to be clever. I hope you didn’t go behaving like
that to poor Freddy.”
George’s eyes laughed, and Lucy suspected that he and her mother would
get on rather well.
“No, I didn’t,” he said. “He behaved that way to me. It is his
philosophy. Only he starts life with it; and I have tried the Note of
Interrogation first.”
“What _do_ you mean? No, never mind what you mean. Don’t explain. He
looks forward to seeing you this afternoon. Do you play tennis? Do you
mind tennis on Sunday—?”
“George mind tennis on Sunday! George, after his education, distinguish
between Sunday—”
“Very well, George doesn’t mind tennis on Sunday. No more do I. That’s
settled. Mr. Emerson, if you could come with your son we should be so
pleased.”
He thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter
about in these days.
She turned to George: “And then he wants to give up his house to the
Miss Alans.”
“I know,” said George, and put his arm round his father’s neck. The
kindness that Mr. Beebe and Lucy had always known to exist in him came
out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape—a touch of the
morning sun? She remembered that in all his perversities he had never
spoken against affection.
Miss Bartlett approached.
“You know our cousin, Miss Bartlett,” said Mrs. Honeychurch pleasantly.
“You met her with my daughter in Florence.”
“Yes, indeed!” said the old man, and made as if he would come out of
the garden to meet the lady. Miss Bartlett promptly got into the
victoria. Thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. It was the pension
Bertolini again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine.
It was the old, old battle of the room with the view.
George did not respond to the bow. Like any boy, he blushed and was
ashamed; he knew that the chaperon remembered. He said: “I—I’ll come up
to tennis if I can manage it,” and went into the house. Perhaps
anything that he did would have pleased Lucy, but his awkwardness went
straight to her heart; men were not gods after all, but as human and as
clumsy as girls; even men might suffer from unexplained desires, and
need help. To one of her upbringing, and of her destination, the
weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar, but she had surmised it at
Florence, when George threw her photographs into the River Arno.
“George, don’t go,” cried his father, who thought it a great treat for
people if his son would talk to them. “George has been in such good
spirits today, and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.”
Lucy caught her cousin’s eye. Something in its mute appeal made her
reckless. “Yes,” she said, raising her voice, “I do hope he will.” Then
she went to the carriage and murmured, “The old man hasn’t been told; I
knew it was all right.” Mrs. Honeychurch followed her, and they drove
away.
Satisfactory that Mr. Emerson had not been told of the Florence
escapade; yet Lucy’s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had
sighted the ramparts of heaven. Satisfactory; yet surely she greeted it
with disproportionate joy. All the way home the horses’ hoofs sang a
tune to her: “He has not told, he has not told.” Her brain expanded the
melody: “He has not told his father—to whom he tells all things. It was
not an exploit. He did not laugh at me when I had gone.” She raised her
hand to her cheek. “He does not love me. No. How terrible if he did!
But he has not told. He will not tell.”
She longed to shout the words: “It is all right. It’s a secret between
us two for ever. Cecil will never hear.” She was even glad that Miss
Bartlett had made her promise secrecy, that last dark evening at
Florence, when they had knelt packing in his room. The secret, big or
little, was guarded.
Only three English people knew of it in the world. Thus she interpreted
her joy. She greeted Cecil with unusual radiance, because she felt so
safe. As he helped her out of the carriage, she said:
“The Emersons have been so nice. George Emerson has improved
enormously.”
“How are my protégés?” asked Cecil, who took no real interest in them,
and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy
Corner for educational purposes.
“Protégés!” she exclaimed with some warmth. For the only relationship
which Cecil conceived was feudal: that of protector and protected. He
had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl’s soul yearned.
“You shall see for yourself how your protégés are. George Emerson is
coming up this afternoon. He is a most interesting man to talk to. Only
don’t—” She nearly said, “Don’t protect him.” But the bell was ringing
for lunch, and, as often happened, Cecil had paid no great attention to
her remarks. Charm, not argument, was to be her forte.
Lunch was a cheerful meal. Generally Lucy was depressed at meals. Some
one had to be soothed—either Cecil or Miss Bartlett or a Being not
visible to the mortal eye—a Being who whispered to her soul: “It will
not last, this cheerfulness. In January you must go to London to
entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men.” But to-day she felt she
had received a guarantee. Her mother would always sit there, her
brother here. The sun, though it had moved a little since the morning,
would never be hidden behind the western hills. After luncheon they
asked her to play. She had seen Gluck’s Armide that year, and played
from memory the music of the enchanted garden—the music to which Renaud
approaches, beneath the light of an eternal dawn, the music that never
gains, never wanes, but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of
fairyland. Such music is not for the piano, and her audience began to
get restive, and Cecil, sharing the discontent, called out: “Now play
us the other garden—the one in Parsifal.”
She closed the instrument.
“Not very dutiful,” said her mother’s voice.
Fearing that she had offended Cecil, she turned quickly round. There
George was. He had crept in without interrupting her.
“Oh, I had no idea!” she exclaimed, getting very red; and then, without
a word of greeting, she reopened the piano. Cecil should have the
Parsifal, and anything else that he liked.
“Our performer has changed her mind,” said Miss Bartlett, perhaps
implying, she will play the music to Mr. Emerson. Lucy did not know
what to do nor even what she wanted to do. She played a few bars of the
Flower Maidens’ song very badly and then she stopped.
“I vote tennis,” said Freddy, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment.
“Yes, so do I.” Once more she closed the unfortunate piano. “I vote you
have a men’s four.”
“All right.”
“Not for me, thank you,” said Cecil. “I will not spoil the set.” He
never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to
make up a fourth.
“Oh, come along Cecil. I’m bad, Floyd’s rotten, and so I dare say’s
Emerson.”
George corrected him: “I am not bad.”
One looked down one’s nose at this. “Then certainly I won’t play,” said
Cecil, while Miss Bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing
George, added: “I agree with you, Mr. Vyse. You had much better not
play. Much better not.”
Minnie, rushing in where Cecil feared to tread, announced that she
would play. “I shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?”
But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.
“Then it will have to be Lucy,” said Mrs. Honeychurch; “you must fall
back on Lucy. There is no other way out of it. Lucy, go and change your
frock.”
Lucy’s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. She kept it
without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in
the afternoon. As she changed her frock, she wondered whether Cecil was
sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything
up before she married him.
Mr. Floyd was her partner. She liked music, but how much better tennis
seemed. How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit
at the piano and feel girt under the arms. Once more music appeared to
her the employment of a child. George served, and surprised her by his
anxiety to win. She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at
Santa Croce because things wouldn’t fit; how after the death of that
obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by the Arno and said to
her: “I shall want to live, I tell you.” He wanted to live now, to win
at tennis, to stand for all he was worth in the sun—the sun which had
begun to decline and was shining in her eyes; and he did win.
Ah, how beautiful the Weald looked! The hills stood out above its
radiance, as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain, and the South
Downs, if one chose, were the mountains of Carrara. She might be
forgetting her Italy, but she was noticing more things in her England.
One could play a new game with the view, and try to find in its
innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence. Ah,
how beautiful the Weald looked!
But now Cecil claimed her. He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood,
and would not sympathize with exaltation. He had been rather a nuisance
all through the tennis, for the novel that he was reading was so bad
that he was obliged to read it aloud to others. He would stroll round
the precincts of the court and call out: “I say, listen to this, Lucy.
Three split infinitives.”
“Dreadful!” said Lucy, and missed her stroke. When they had finished
their set, he still went on reading; there was some murder scene, and
really everyone must listen to it. Freddy and Mr. Floyd were obliged to
hunt for a lost ball in the laurels, but the other two acquiesced.
“The scene is laid in Florence.”
“What fun, Cecil! Read away. Come, Mr. Emerson, sit down after all your
energy.” She had “forgiven” George, as she put it, and she made a point
of being pleasant to him.
He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking: “You—and are
you tired?”
“Of course I’m not!”
“Do you mind being beaten?”
She was going to answer, “No,” when it struck her that she did mind, so
she answered, “Yes.” She added merrily, “I don’t see _you’re_ such a
splendid player, though. The light was behind you, and it was in my
eyes.”
“I never said I was.”
“Why, you did!”
“You didn’t attend.”
“You said—oh, don’t go in for accuracy at this house. We all
exaggerate, and we get very angry with people who don’t.”
“‘The scene is laid in Florence,’” repeated Cecil, with an upward note.
Lucy recollected herself.
“‘Sunset. Leonora was speeding—’”
Lucy interrupted. “Leonora? Is Leonora the heroine? Who’s the book by?”
“Joseph Emery Prank. ‘Sunset. Leonora speeding across the square. Pray
the saints she might not arrive too late. Sunset—the sunset of Italy.
Under Orcagna’s Loggia—the Loggia de’ Lanzi, as we sometimes call it
now—’”
Lucy burst into laughter. “‘Joseph Emery Prank’ indeed! Why it’s Miss
Lavish! It’s Miss Lavish’s novel, and she’s publishing it under
somebody else’s name.”
“Who may Miss Lavish be?”
“Oh, a dreadful person—Mr. Emerson, you remember Miss Lavish?”
Excited by her pleasant afternoon, she clapped her hands.
George looked up. “Of course I do. I saw her the day I arrived at
Summer Street. It was she who told me that you lived here.”
“Weren’t you pleased?” She meant “to see Miss Lavish,” but when he bent
down to the grass without replying, it struck her that she could mean
something else. She watched his head, which was almost resting against
her knee, and she thought that the ears were reddening. “No wonder the
novel’s bad,” she added. “I never liked Miss Lavish. But I suppose one
ought to read it as one’s met her.”
“All modern books are bad,” said Cecil, who was annoyed at her
inattention, and vented his annoyance on literature. “Every one writes
for money in these days.”
“Oh, Cecil—!”
“It is so. I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”
Cecil, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow. The ups and
downs in his voice were noticeable, but they did not affect her. She
had dwelt amongst melody and movement, and her nerves refused to answer
to the clang of his. Leaving him to be annoyed, she gazed at the black
head again. She did not want to stroke it, but she saw herself wanting
to stroke it; the sensation was curious.
“How do you like this view of ours, Mr. Emerson?”
“I never notice much difference in views.”
“What do you mean?”
“Because they’re all alike. Because all that matters in them is
distance and air.”
“H’m!” said Cecil, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not.
“My father”—he looked up at her (and he was a little flushed)—“says
that there is only one perfect view—the view of the sky straight over
our heads, and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of
it.”
“I expect your father has been reading Dante,” said Cecil, fingering
the novel, which alone permitted him to lead the conversation.
“He told us another day that views are really crowds—crowds of trees
and houses and hills—and are bound to resemble each other, like human
crowds—and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural,
for the same reason.”
Lucy’s lips parted.
“For a crowd is more than the people who make it up. Something gets
added to it—no one knows how—just as something has got added to those
hills.”
He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs.
“What a splendid idea!” she murmured. “I shall enjoy hearing your
father talk again. I’m so sorry he’s not so well.”
“No, he isn’t well.”
“There’s an absurd account of a view in this book,” said Cecil. “Also
that men fall into two classes—those who forget views and those who
remember them, even in small rooms.”
“Mr. Emerson, have you any brothers or sisters?”
“None. Why?”
“You spoke of ‘us.’”
“My mother, I was meaning.”
Cecil closed the novel with a bang.
“Oh, Cecil—how you made me jump!”
“I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer.”
“I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day
and seeing as far as Hindhead. It is the first thing that I remember.”
Cecil got up; the man was ill-bred—he hadn’t put on his coat after
tennis—he didn’t do. He would have strolled away if Lucy had not
stopped him.
“Cecil, do read the thing about the view.”
“Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us.”
“No—read away. I think nothing’s funnier than to hear silly things read
out loud. If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous, he can go.”
This struck Cecil as subtle, and pleased him. It put their visitor in
the position of a prig. Somewhat mollified, he sat down again.
“Mr. Emerson, go and find tennis balls.” She opened the book. Cecil
must have his reading and anything else that he liked. But her
attention wandered to George’s mother, who—according to Mr. Eager—had
been murdered in the sight of God and—according to her son—had seen as
far as Hindhead.
“Am I really to go?” asked George.
“No, of course not really,” she answered.
“Chapter two,” said Cecil, yawning. “Find me chapter two, if it isn’t
bothering you.”
Chapter two was found, and she glanced at its opening sentences.
She thought she had gone mad.
“Here—hand me the book.”
She heard her voice saying: “It isn’t worth reading—it’s too silly to
read—I never saw such rubbish—it oughtn’t to be allowed to be printed.”
He took the book from her.
“‘Leonora,’” he read, “‘sat pensive and alone. Before her lay the rich
champaign of Tuscany, dotted over with many a smiling village. The
season was spring.’”
Miss Lavish knew, somehow, and had printed the past in draggled prose,
for Cecil to read and for George to hear.
“‘A golden haze,’” he read. He read: “‘Afar off the towers of Florence,
while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets. All
unobserved Antonio stole up behind her—’”
Lest Cecil should see her face she turned to George and saw his face.
He read: “‘There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as
formal lovers use. No eloquence was his, nor did he suffer from the
lack of it. He simply enfolded her in his manly arms.’”
“This isn’t the passage I wanted,” he informed them, “there is another
much funnier, further on.” He turned over the leaves.
“Should we go in to tea?” said Lucy, whose voice remained steady.
She led the way up the garden, Cecil following her, George last. She
thought a disaster was averted. But when they entered the shrubbery it
came. The book, as if it had not worked mischief enough, had been
forgotten, and Cecil must go back for it; and George, who loved
passionately, must blunder against her in the narrow path.
“No—” she gasped, and, for the second time, was kissed by him.
As if no more was possible, he slipped back; Cecil rejoined her; they
reached the upper lawn alone.
Chapter XVI
Lying to George
But Lucy had developed since the spring. That is to say, she was now
better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the
world disapprove. Though the danger was greater, she was not shaken by
deep sobs. She said to Cecil, “I am not coming in to tea—tell mother—I
must write some letters,” and went up to her room. Then she prepared
for action. Love felt and returned, love which our bodies exact and our
hearts have transfigured, love which is the most real thing that we
shall ever meet, reappeared now as the world’s enemy, and she must
stifle it.
She sent for Miss Bartlett.
The contest lay not between love and duty. Perhaps there never is such
a contest. It lay between the real and the pretended, and Lucy’s first
aim was to defeat herself. As her brain clouded over, as the memory of
the views grew dim and the words of the book died away, she returned to
her old shibboleth of nerves. She “conquered her breakdown.” Tampering
with the truth, she forgot that the truth had ever been. Remembering
that she was engaged to Cecil, she compelled herself to confused
remembrances of George; he was nothing to her; he never had been
anything; he had behaved abominably; she had never encouraged him. The
armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness, and hides a man
not only from others, but from his own soul. In a few moments Lucy was
equipped for battle.
“Something too awful has happened,” she began, as soon as her cousin
arrived. “Do you know anything about Miss Lavish’s novel?”
Miss Bartlett looked surprised, and said that she had not read the
book, nor known that it was published; Eleanor was a reticent woman at
heart.
“There is a scene in it. The hero and heroine make love. Do you know
about that?”
“Dear—?”
“Do you know about it, please?” she repeated. “They are on a hillside,
and Florence is in the distance.”
“My good Lucia, I am all at sea. I know nothing about it whatever.”
“There are violets. I cannot believe it is a coincidence. Charlotte,
Charlotte, how _could_ you have told her? I have thought before
speaking; it _must_ be you.”
“Told her what?” she asked, with growing agitation.
“About that dreadful afternoon in February.”
Miss Bartlett was genuinely moved. “Oh, Lucy, dearest girl—she hasn’t
put that in her book?”
Lucy nodded.
“Not so that one could recognize it. Yes.”
“Then never—never—never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”
“So you did tell?”
“I did just happen—when I had tea with her at Rome—in the course of
conversation—”
“But Charlotte—what about the promise you gave me when we were packing?
Why did you tell Miss Lavish, when you wouldn’t even let me tell
mother?”
“I will never forgive Eleanor. She has betrayed my confidence.”
“Why did you tell her, though? This is a most serious thing.”
Why does any one tell anything? The question is eternal, and it was not
surprising that Miss Bartlett should only sigh faintly in response. She
had done wrong—she admitted it, she only hoped that she had not done
harm; she had told Eleanor in the strictest confidence.
Lucy stamped with irritation.
“Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson;
it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again. Behind Cecil’s back.
Ugh! Is it possible that men are such brutes? Behind Cecil’s back as we
were walking up the garden.”
Miss Bartlett burst into self-accusations and regrets.
“What is to be done now? Can you tell me?”
“Oh, Lucy—I shall never forgive myself, never to my dying day. Fancy if
your prospects—”
“I know,” said Lucy, wincing at the word. “I see now why you wanted me
to tell Cecil, and what you meant by ‘some other source.’ You knew that
you had told Miss Lavish, and that she was not reliable.”
It was Miss Bartlett’s turn to wince. “However,” said the girl,
despising her cousin’s shiftiness, “What’s done’s done. You have put me
in a most awkward position. How am I to get out of it?”
Miss Bartlett could not think. The days of her energy were over. She
was a visitor, not a chaperon, and a discredited visitor at that. She
stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the
necessary rage.
“He must—that man must have such a setting down that he won’t forget.
And who’s to give it him? I can’t tell mother now—owing to you. Nor
Cecil, Charlotte, owing to you. I am caught up every way. I think I
shall go mad. I have no one to help me. That’s why I’ve sent for you.
What’s wanted is a man with a whip.”
Miss Bartlett agreed: one wanted a man with a whip.
“Yes—but it’s no good agreeing. What’s to be _done?_ We women go
maundering on. What _does_ a girl do when she comes across a cad?”
“I always said he was a cad, dear. Give me credit for that, at all
events. From the very first moment—when he said his father was having a
bath.”
“Oh, bother the credit and who’s been right or wrong! We’ve both made a
muddle of it. George Emerson is still down the garden there, and is he
to be left unpunished, or isn’t he? I want to know.”
Miss Bartlett was absolutely helpless. Her own exposure had unnerved
her, and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain. She moved
feebly to the window, and tried to detect the cad’s white flannels
among the laurels.
“You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome.
Can’t you speak again to him now?”
“Willingly would I move heaven and earth—”
“I want something more definite,” said Lucy contemptuously. “Will you
speak to him? It is the least you can do, surely, considering it all
happened because you broke your word.”
“Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine.”
Really, Charlotte was outdoing herself.
“Yes or no, please; yes or no.”
“It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle.” George
Emerson was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand.
“Very well,” said Lucy, with an angry gesture. “No one will help me. I
will speak to him myself.” And immediately she realized that this was
what her cousin had intended all along.
“Hullo, Emerson!” called Freddy from below. “Found the lost ball? Good
man! Want any tea?” And there was an irruption from the house on to the
terrace.
“Oh, Lucy, but that is brave of you! I admire you—”
They had gathered round George, who beckoned, she felt, over the
rubbish, the sloppy thoughts, the furtive yearnings that were beginning
to cumber her soul. Her anger faded at the sight of him. Ah! The
Emersons were fine people in their way. She had to subdue a rush in her
blood before saying:
“Freddy has taken him into the dining-room. The others are going down
the garden. Come. Let us get this over quickly. Come. I want you in the
room, of course.”
“Lucy, do you mind doing it?”
“How can you ask such a ridiculous question?”
“Poor Lucy—” She stretched out her hand. “I seem to bring nothing but
misfortune wherever I go.” Lucy nodded. She remembered their last
evening at Florence—the packing, the candle, the shadow of Miss
Bartlett’s toque on the door. She was not to be trapped by pathos a
second time. Eluding her cousin’s caress, she led the way downstairs.
“Try the jam,” Freddy was saying. “The jam’s jolly good.”
George, looking big and dishevelled, was pacing up and down the
dining-room. As she entered he stopped, and said:
“No—nothing to eat.”
“You go down to the others,” said Lucy; “Charlotte and I will give Mr.
Emerson all he wants. Where’s mother?”
“She’s started on her Sunday writing. She’s in the drawing-room.”
“That’s all right. You go away.”
He went off singing.
Lucy sat down at the table. Miss Bartlett, who was thoroughly
frightened, took up a book and pretended to read.
She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech. She just said: “I
can’t have it, Mr. Emerson. I cannot even talk to you. Go out of this
house, and never come into it again as long as I live here—” flushing
as she spoke and pointing to the door. “I hate a row. Go please.”
“What—”
“No discussion.”
“But I can’t—”
She shook her head. “Go, please. I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse.”
“You don’t mean,” he said, absolutely ignoring Miss Bartlett—“you don’t
mean that you are going to marry that man?”
The line was unexpected.
She shrugged her shoulders, as if his vulgarity wearied her. “You are
merely ridiculous,” she said quietly.
Then his words rose gravely over hers: “You cannot live with Vyse. He’s
only for an acquaintance. He is for society and cultivated talk. He
should know no one intimately, least of all a woman.”
It was a new light on Cecil’s character.
“Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired?”
“I can scarcely discuss—”
“No, but have you ever? He is the sort who are all right so long as
they keep to things—books, pictures—but kill when they come to people.
That’s why I’ll speak out through all this muddle even now. It’s
shocking enough to lose you in any case, but generally a man must deny
himself joy, and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a
different person. I would never have let myself go. But I saw him first
in the National Gallery, when he winced because my father mispronounced
the names of great painters. Then he brings us here, and we find it is
to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour. That is the man all
over—playing tricks on people, on the most sacred form of life that he
can find. Next, I meet you together, and find him protecting and
teaching you and your mother to be shocked, when it was for _you_ to
settle whether you were shocked or no. Cecil all over again. He daren’t
let a woman decide. He’s the type who’s kept Europe back for a thousand
years. Every moment of his life he’s forming you, telling you what’s
charming or amusing or ladylike, telling you what a man thinks womanly;
and you, you of all women, listen to his voice instead of to your own.
So it was at the Rectory, when I met you both again; so it has been the
whole of this afternoon. Therefore—not ‘therefore I kissed you,’
because the book made me do that, and I wish to goodness I had more
self-control. I’m not ashamed. I don’t apologize. But it has frightened
you, and you may not have noticed that I love you. Or would you have
told me to go, and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly? But
therefore—therefore I settled to fight him.”
Lucy thought of a very good remark.
“You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him, Mr. Emerson. Pardon me for
suggesting that you have caught the habit.”
And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality. He
said:
“Yes, I have,” and sank down as if suddenly weary. “I’m the same kind
of brute at bottom. This desire to govern a woman—it lies very deep,
and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the
garden. But I do love you surely in a better way than he does.” He
thought. “Yes—really in a better way. I want you to have your own
thoughts even when I hold you in my arms.” He stretched them towards
her. “Lucy, be quick—there’s no time for us to talk now—come to me as
you came in the spring, and afterwards I will be gentle and explain. I
have cared for you since that man died. I cannot live without you, ‘No
good,’ I thought; ‘she is marrying someone else’; but I meet you again
when all the world is glorious water and sun. As you came through the
wood I saw that nothing else mattered. I called. I wanted to live and
have my chance of joy.”
“And Mr. Vyse?” said Lucy, who kept commendably calm. “Does he not
matter? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly? A detail of no
importance, I suppose?”
But he stretched his arms over the table towards her.
“May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition?”
He said: “It is our last chance. I shall do all that I can.” And as if
he had done all else, he turned to Miss Bartlett, who sat like some
portent against the skies of the evening. “You wouldn’t stop us this
second time if you understood,” he said. “I have been into the dark,
and I am going back into it, unless you will try to understand.”
Her long, narrow head drove backwards and forwards, as though
demolishing some invisible obstacle. She did not answer.
“It is being young,” he said quietly, picking up his racquet from the
floor and preparing to go. “It is being certain that Lucy cares for me
really. It is that love and youth matter intellectually.”
In silence the two women watched him. His last remark, they knew, was
nonsense, but was he going after it or not? Would not he, the cad, the
charlatan, attempt a more dramatic finish? No. He was apparently
content. He left them, carefully closing the front door; and when they
looked through the hall window, they saw him go up the drive and begin
to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house. Their tongues
were loosed, and they burst into stealthy rejoicings.
“Oh, Lucia—come back here—oh, what an awful man!”
Lucy had no reaction—at least, not yet. “Well, he amuses me,” she said.
“Either I’m mad, or else he is, and I’m inclined to think it’s the
latter. One more fuss through with you, Charlotte. Many thanks. I
think, though, that this is the last. My admirer will hardly trouble me
again.”
And Miss Bartlett, too, essayed the roguish:
“Well, it isn’t everyone who could boast such a conquest, dearest, is
it? Oh, one oughtn’t to laugh, really. It might have been very serious.
But you were so sensible and brave—so unlike the girls of my day.”
“Let’s go down to them.”
But, once in the open air, she paused. Some emotion—pity, terror, love,
but the emotion was strong—seized her, and she was aware of autumn.
Summer was ending, and the evening brought her odours of decay, the
more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring. That something
or other mattered intellectually? A leaf, violently agitated, danced
past her, while other leaves lay motionless. That the earth was
hastening to re-enter darkness, and the shadows of those trees over
Windy Corner?
“Hullo, Lucy! There’s still light enough for another set, if you two’ll
hurry.”
“Mr. Emerson has had to go.”
“What a nuisance! That spoils the four. I say, Cecil, do play, do,
there’s a good chap. It’s Floyd’s last day. Do play tennis with us,
just this once.”
Cecil’s voice came: “My dear Freddy, I am no athlete. As you well
remarked this very morning, ‘There are some chaps who are no good for
anything but books’; I plead guilty to being such a chap, and will not
inflict myself on you.”
The scales fell from Lucy’s eyes. How had she stood Cecil for a moment?
He was absolutely intolerable, and the same evening she broke off her
engagement.
Chapter XVII
Lying to Cecil
He was bewildered. He had nothing to say. He was not even angry, but
stood, with a glass of whiskey between his hands, trying to think what
had led her to such a conclusion.
She had chosen the moment before bed, when, in accordance with their
bourgeois habit, she always dispensed drinks to the men. Freddy and Mr.
Floyd were sure to retire with their glasses, while Cecil invariably
lingered, sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard.
“I am very sorry about it,” she said; “I have carefully thought things
over. We are too different. I must ask you to release me, and try to
forget that there ever was such a foolish girl.”
It was a suitable speech, but she was more angry than sorry, and her
voice showed it.
“Different—how—how—”
“I haven’t had a really good education, for one thing,” she continued,
still on her knees by the sideboard. “My Italian trip came too late,
and I am forgetting all that I learnt there. I shall never be able to
talk to your friends, or behave as a wife of yours should.”
“I don’t understand you. You aren’t like yourself. You’re tired, Lucy.”
“Tired!” she retorted, kindling at once. “That is exactly like you. You
always think women don’t mean what they say.”
“Well, you sound tired, as if something has worried you.”
“What if I do? It doesn’t prevent me from realizing the truth. I can’t
marry you, and you will thank me for saying so some day.”
“You had that bad headache yesterday—All right”—for she had exclaimed
indignantly: “I see it’s much more than headaches. But give me a
moment’s time.” He closed his eyes. “You must excuse me if I say stupid
things, but my brain has gone to pieces. Part of it lives three minutes
back, when I was sure that you loved me, and the other part—I find it
difficult—I am likely to say the wrong thing.”
It struck her that he was not behaving so badly, and her irritation
increased. She again desired a struggle, not a discussion. To bring on
the crisis, she said:
“There are days when one sees clearly, and this is one of them. Things
must come to a breaking-point some time, and it happens to be to-day.
If you want to know, quite a little thing decided me to speak to
you—when you wouldn’t play tennis with Freddy.”
“I never do play tennis,” said Cecil, painfully bewildered; “I never
could play. I don’t understand a word you say.”
“You can play well enough to make up a four. I thought it abominably
selfish of you.”
“No, I can’t—well, never mind the tennis. Why couldn’t you—couldn’t you
have warned me if you felt anything wrong? You talked of our wedding at
lunch—at least, you let me talk.”
“I knew you wouldn’t understand,” said Lucy quite crossly. “I might
have known there would have been these dreadful explanations. Of
course, it isn’t the tennis—that was only the last straw to all I have
been feeling for weeks. Surely it was better not to speak until I felt
certain.” She developed this position. “Often before I have wondered if
I was fitted for your wife—for instance, in London; and are you fitted
to be my husband? I don’t think so. You don’t like Freddy, nor my
mother. There was always a lot against our engagement, Cecil, but all
our relations seemed pleased, and we met so often, and it was no good
mentioning it until—well, until all things came to a point. They have
to-day. I see clearly. I must speak. That’s all.”
“I cannot think you were right,” said Cecil gently. “I cannot tell why,
but though all that you say sounds true, I feel that you are not
treating me fairly. It’s all too horrible.”
“What’s the good of a scene?”
“No good. But surely I have a right to hear a little more.”
He put down his glass and opened the window. From where she knelt,
jangling her keys, she could see a slit of darkness, and, peering into
it, as if it would tell him that “little more,” his long, thoughtful
face.
“Don’t open the window; and you’d better draw the curtain, too; Freddy
or any one might be outside.” He obeyed. “I really think we had better
go to bed, if you don’t mind. I shall only say things that will make me
unhappy afterwards. As you say it is all too horrible, and it is no
good talking.”
But to Cecil, now that he was about to lose her, she seemed each moment
more desirable. He looked at her, instead of through her, for the first
time since they were engaged. From a Leonardo she had become a living
woman, with mysteries and forces of her own, with qualities that even
eluded art. His brain recovered from the shock, and, in a burst of
genuine devotion, he cried: “But I love you, and I did think you loved
me!”
“I did not,” she said. “I thought I did at first. I am sorry, and ought
to have refused you this last time, too.”
He began to walk up and down the room, and she grew more and more vexed
at his dignified behaviour. She had counted on his being petty. It
would have made things easier for her. By a cruel irony she was drawing
out all that was finest in his disposition.
“You don’t love me, evidently. I dare say you are right not to. But it
would hurt a little less if I knew why.”
“Because”—a phrase came to her, and she accepted it—“you’re the sort
who can’t know any one intimately.”
A horrified look came into his eyes.
“I don’t mean exactly that. But you will question me, though I beg you
not to, and I must say something. It is that, more or less. When we
were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you’re always
protecting me.” Her voice swelled. “I won’t be protected. I will choose
for myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can’t
I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through
you? A woman’s place! You despise my mother—I know you do—because she’s
conventional and bothers over puddings; but, oh goodness!”—she rose to
her feet—“conventional, Cecil, you’re that, for you may understand
beautiful things, but you don’t know how to use them; and you wrap
yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me. I
won’t be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more
glorious, and you hide them from me. That’s why I break off my
engagement. You were all right as long as you kept to things, but when
you came to people—” She stopped.
There was a pause. Then Cecil said with great emotion:
“It is true.”
“True on the whole,” she corrected, full of some vague shame.
“True, every word. It is a revelation. It is—I.”
“Anyhow, those are my reasons for not being your wife.”
He repeated: “‘The sort that can know no one intimately.’ It is true. I
fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged. I behaved like a cad
to Beebe and to your brother. You are even greater than I thought.” She
withdrew a step. “I’m not going to worry you. You are far too good to
me. I shall never forget your insight; and, dear, I only blame you for
this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt you
wouldn’t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. I have
never known you till this evening. I have just used you as a peg for my
silly notions of what a woman should be. But this evening you are a
different person: new thoughts—even a new voice—”
“What do you mean by a new voice?” she asked, seized with
incontrollable anger.
“I mean that a new person seems speaking through you,” said he.
Then she lost her balance. She cried: “If you think I am in love with
some one else, you are very much mistaken.”
“Of course I don’t think that. You are not that kind, Lucy.”
“Oh, yes, you do think it. It’s your old idea, the idea that has kept
Europe back—I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men. If a
girl breaks off her engagement, everyone says: ‘Oh, she had someone
else in her mind; she hopes to get someone else.’ It’s disgusting,
brutal! As if a girl can’t break it off for the sake of freedom.”
He answered reverently: “I may have said that in the past. I shall
never say it again. You have taught me better.”
She began to redden, and pretended to examine the windows again.
“Of course, there is no question of ‘someone else’ in this, no
‘jilting’ or any such nauseous stupidity. I beg your pardon most humbly
if my words suggested that there was. I only meant that there was a
force in you that I hadn’t known of up till now.”
“All right, Cecil, that will do. Don’t apologize to me. It was my
mistake.”
“It is a question between ideals, yours and mine—pure abstract ideals,
and yours are the nobler. I was bound up in the old vicious notions,
and all the time you were splendid and new.” His voice broke. “I must
actually thank you for what you have done—for showing me what I really
am. Solemnly, I thank you for showing me a true woman. Will you shake
hands?”
“Of course I will,” said Lucy, twisting up her other hand in the
curtains. “Good-night, Cecil. Good-bye. That’s all right. I’m sorry
about it. Thank you very much for your gentleness.”
“Let me light your candle, shall I?”
They went into the hall.
“Thank you. Good-night again. God bless you, Lucy!”
“Good-bye, Cecil.”
She watched him steal up-stairs, while the shadows from three banisters
passed over her face like the beat of wings. On the landing he paused
strong in his renunciation, and gave her a look of memorable beauty.
For all his culture, Cecil was an ascetic at heart, and nothing in his
love became him like the leaving of it.
She could never marry. In the tumult of her soul, that stood firm.
Cecil believed in her; she must some day believe in herself. She must
be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently, who care for
liberty and not for men; she must forget that George loved her, that
George had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable
release, that George had gone away into—what was it?—the darkness.
She put out the lamp.
It did not do to think, nor, for the matter of that, to feel. She gave
up trying to understand herself, and joined the vast armies of the
benighted, who follow neither the heart nor the brain, and march to
their destiny by catch-words. The armies are full of pleasant and pious
folk. But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters—the enemy
within. They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be
their strife after virtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their
pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism,
their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort
wherever they go. They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas
Athene, and not by any heavenly intervention, but by the ordinary
course of nature, those allied deities will be avenged.
Lucy entered this army when she pretended to George that she did not
love him, and pretended to Cecil that she loved no one. The night
received her, as it had received Miss Bartlett thirty years before.
Chapter XVIII
Lying to Mr. Beebe, Mrs. Honeychurch, Freddy, and The Servants
Windy Corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred
feet down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great
buttresses that supported the hill. On either side of it was a shallow
ravine, filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the
left ran the highway into the Weald.
Whenever Mr. Beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble
dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, Windy
Corner,—he laughed. The situation was so glorious, the house so
commonplace, not to say impertinent. The late Mr. Honeychurch had
affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his
money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret,
shaped like a rhinoceros’ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and
watch the carts going up and down the road. So impertinent—and yet the
house “did,” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings
honestly. Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive
architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all
these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while Windy Corner
seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of Nature’s own creation. One might
laugh at the house, but one never shuddered. Mr. Beebe was bicycling
over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. He had heard from
the Miss Alans. These admirable ladies, since they could not go to
Cissie Villa, had changed their plans. They were going to Greece
instead.
“Since Florence did my poor sister so much good,” wrote Miss Catharine,
“we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter. Of course,
Athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive
bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, and it is only getting
first into a steamer and then into a train. But is there an English
Church?” And the letter went on to say: “I do not expect we shall go
any further than Athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable
pension at Constantinople, we should be so grateful.”
Lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which Mr. Beebe
greeted Windy Corner was partly for her. She would see the fun of it,
and some of its beauty, for she must see some beauty. Though she was
hopeless about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly—oh, that
cerise frock yesterday at church!—she must see some beauty in life, or
she could not play the piano as she did. He had a theory that musicians
are incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they
want and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their
friends; that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet
been understood. This theory, had he known it, had possibly just been
illustrated by facts. Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only
riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether
Miss Honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies
to visit Athens.
A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner, and just as he caught
sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped
abruptly when it reached the main road. Therefore it must be the horse,
who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him.
The door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom Mr. Beebe
recognized as Cecil and Freddy. They were an odd couple to go driving;
but he saw a trunk beside the coachman’s legs. Cecil, who wore a
bowler, must be going away, while Freddy (a cap)—was seeing him to the
station. They walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the
summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.
They shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.
“So you’re off for a minute, Mr. Vyse?” he asked.
Cecil said, “Yes,” while Freddy edged away.
“I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of
Miss Honeychurch.” He quoted from it. “Isn’t it wonderful? Isn’t it
romance? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople. They are taken
in a snare that cannot fail. They will end by going round the world.”
Cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that Lucy would be amused
and interested.
“Isn’t Romance capricious! I never notice it in you young people; you
do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while
the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against
the terrible thing. ‘A really comfortable pension at Constantinople!’
So they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension
with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland
forlorn! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans. They want the
Pension Keats.”
“I’m awfully sorry to interrupt, Mr. Beebe,” said Freddy, “but have you
any matches?”
“I have,” said Cecil, and it did not escape Mr. Beebe’s notice that he
spoke to the boy more kindly.
“You have never met these Miss Alans, have you, Mr. Vyse?”
“Never.”
“Then you don’t see the wonder of this Greek visit. I haven’t been to
Greece myself, and don’t mean to go, and I can’t imagine any of my
friends going. It is altogether too big for our little lot. Don’t you
think so? Italy is just about as much as we can manage. Italy is
heroic, but Greece is godlike or devilish—I am not sure which, and in
either case absolutely out of our suburban focus. All right, Freddy—I
am not being clever, upon my word I am not—I took the idea from another
fellow; and give me those matches when you’ve done with them.” He lit a
cigarette, and went on talking to the two young men. “I was saying, if
our poor little Cockney lives must have a background, let it be
Italian. Big enough in all conscience. The ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel for me. There the contrast is just as much as I can realize. But
not the Parthenon, not the frieze of Phidias at any price; and here
comes the victoria.”
“You’re quite right,” said Cecil. “Greece is not for our little lot”;
and he got in. Freddy followed, nodding to the clergyman, whom he
trusted not to be pulling one’s leg, really. And before they had gone a
dozen yards he jumped out, and came running back for Vyse’s match-box,
which had not been returned. As he took it, he said: “I’m so glad you
only talked about books. Cecil’s hard hit. Lucy won’t marry him. If
you’d gone on about her, as you did about them, he might have broken
down.”
“But when—”
“Late last night. I must go.”
“Perhaps they won’t want me down there.”
“No—go on. Good-bye.”
“Thank goodness!” exclaimed Mr. Beebe to himself, and struck the saddle
of his bicycle approvingly, “It was the one foolish thing she ever did.
Oh, what a glorious riddance!” And, after a little thought, he
negotiated the slope into Windy Corner, light of heart. The house was
again as it ought to be—cut off forever from Cecil’s pretentious world.
He would find Miss Minnie down in the garden.
In the drawing-room Lucy was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata. He hesitated
a moment, but went down the garden as requested. There he found a
mournful company. It was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and
broken the dahlias. Mrs. Honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them
up, while Miss Bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of
assistance. At a little distance stood Minnie and the “garden-child,” a
minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.
“Oh, how do you do, Mr. Beebe? Gracious what a mess everything is! Look
at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the
ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage
having to go out, when I had counted on having Powell, who—give
everyone their due—does tie up dahlias properly.”
Evidently Mrs. Honeychurch was shattered.
“How do you do?” said Miss Bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though
conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn
gales.
“Here, Lennie, the bass,” cried Mrs. Honeychurch. The garden-child, who
did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror.
Minnie slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very
disagreeable to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings
would tear longways instead of across.
“Come for a walk with me,” he told her. “You have worried them as much
as they can stand. Mrs. Honeychurch, I only called in aimlessly. I
shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern, if I may.”
“Oh, must you? Yes do.—Not the scissors, thank you, Charlotte, when
both my hands are full already—I’m perfectly certain that the orange
cactus will go before I can get to it.”
Mr. Beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited Miss
Bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.
“Yes, Charlotte, I don’t want you—do go; there’s nothing to stop about
for, either in the house or out of it.”
Miss Bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she
had exasperated everyone, except Minnie, by a refusal, she turned round
and exasperated Minnie by an acceptance. As they walked up the garden,
the orange cactus fell, and Mr. Beebe’s last vision was of the
garden-child clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth
of blossom.
“It is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,” he remarked.
“It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a
moment,” enunciated Miss Bartlett.
“Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother. Or will
she come with us?”
“I think we had better leave Lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.”
“They’re angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for
breakfast,” whispered Minnie, “and Floyd has gone, and Mr. Vyse has
gone, and Freddy won’t play with me. In fact, Uncle Arthur, the house
is not _at all_ what it was yesterday.”
“Don’t be a prig,” said her Uncle Arthur. “Go and put on your boots.”
He stepped into the drawing-room, where Lucy was still attentively
pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart. She stopped when he entered.
“How do you do? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at
the Beehive. Would you come too?”
“I don’t think I will, thank you.”
“No, I didn’t suppose you would care to much.”
Lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.
“How delicate those Sonatas are!” said Mr. Beebe, though at the bottom
of his heart, he thought them silly little things.
Lucy passed into Schumann.
“Miss Honeychurch!”
“Yes.”
“I met them on the hill. Your brother told me.”
“Oh he did?” She sounded annoyed. Mr. Beebe felt hurt, for he had
thought that she would like him to be told.
“I needn’t say that it will go no further.”
“Mother, Charlotte, Cecil, Freddy, you,” said Lucy, playing a note for
each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.
“If you’ll let me say so, I am very glad, and I am certain that you
have done the right thing.”
“So I hoped other people would think, but they don’t seem to.”
“I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise.”
“So does mother. Mother minds dreadfully.”
“I am very sorry for that,” said Mr. Beebe with feeling.
Mrs. Honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as
much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. It was really
a ruse of Lucy’s to justify her despondency—a ruse of which she was not
herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.
“And Freddy minds.”
“Still, Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much, did he? I gathered that
he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.”
“Boys are so odd.”
Minnie could be heard arguing with Miss Bartlett through the floor. Tea
at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel. Mr.
Beebe saw that Lucy—very properly—did not wish to discuss her action,
so after a sincere expression of sympathy, he said, “I have had an
absurd letter from Miss Alan. That was really what brought me over. I
thought it might amuse you all.”
“How delightful!” said Lucy, in a dull voice.
For the sake of something to do, he began to read her the letter. After
a few words her eyes grew alert, and soon she interrupted him with
“Going abroad? When do they start?”
“Next week, I gather.”
“Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back?”
“No, he didn’t.”
“Because I do hope he won’t go gossiping.”
So she did want to talk about her broken engagement. Always
complaisant, he put the letter away. But she, at once exclaimed in a
high voice, “Oh, do tell me more about the Miss Alans! How perfectly
splendid of them to go abroad!”
“I want them to start from Venice, and go in a cargo steamer down the
Illyrian coast!”
She laughed heartily. “Oh, delightful! I wish they’d take me.”
“Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel? Perhaps George Emerson
is right. He says that ‘Italy is only an euphuism for Fate.’”
“Oh, not Italy, but Constantinople. I have always longed to go to
Constantinople. Constantinople is practically Asia, isn’t it?”
Mr. Beebe reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely, and that
the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens, “with Delphi, perhaps, if the
roads are safe.” But this made no difference to her enthusiasm. She had
always longed to go to Greece even more, it seemed. He saw, to his
surprise, that she was apparently serious.
“I didn’t realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends,
after Cissie Villa.”
“Oh, that’s nothing; I assure you Cissie Villa’s nothing to me; I would
give anything to go with them.”
“Would your mother spare you again so soon? You have scarcely been home
three months.”
“She _must_ spare me!” cried Lucy, in growing excitement. “I simply
_must_ go away. I have to.” She ran her fingers hysterically through
her hair. “Don’t you see that I _have_ to go away? I didn’t realize at
the time—and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly.”
“You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel—”
“Yes, yes. I knew you’d understand.”
Mr. Beebe did not quite understand. Why could not Miss Honeychurch
repose in the bosom of her family? Cecil had evidently taken up the
dignified line, and was not going to annoy her. Then it struck him that
her family itself might be annoying. He hinted this to her, and she
accepted the hint eagerly.
“Yes, of course; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the
idea and everything has calmed down.”
“I am afraid it has been a bothersome business,” he said gently.
“No, not at all. Cecil was very kind indeed; only—I had better tell you
the whole truth, since you have heard a little—it was that he is so
masterful. I found that he wouldn’t let me go my own way. He would
improve me in places where I can’t be improved. Cecil won’t let a woman
decide for herself—in fact, he daren’t. What nonsense I do talk! But
that is the kind of thing.”
“It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse; it is what
I gather from all that I have known of you. I do sympathize and agree
most profoundly. I agree so much that you must let me make one little
criticism: Is it worth while rushing off to Greece?”
“But I must go somewhere!” she cried. “I have been worrying all the
morning, and here comes the very thing.” She struck her knees with
clenched fists, and repeated: “I must! And the time I shall have with
mother, and all the money she spent on me last spring. You all think
much too highly of me. I wish you weren’t so kind.” At this moment Miss
Bartlett entered, and her nervousness increased. “I must get away, ever
so far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go.”
“Come along; tea, tea, tea,” said Mr. Beebe, and bustled his guests out
of the front-door. He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat.
When he returned for it he heard, to his relief and surprise, the
tinkling of a Mozart Sonata.
“She is playing again,” he said to Miss Bartlett.
“Lucy can always play,” was the acid reply.
“One is very thankful that she has such a resource. She is evidently
much worried, as, of course, she ought to be. I know all about it. The
marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she
could wind herself up to speak.”
Miss Bartlett gave a kind of wriggle, and he prepared for a discussion.
He had never fathomed Miss Bartlett. As he had put it to himself at
Florence, “she might yet reveal depths of strangeness, if not of
meaning.” But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable. He
assumed that much, and he had no hesitation in discussing Lucy with
her. Minnie was fortunately collecting ferns.
She opened the discussion with: “We had much better let the matter
drop.”
“I wonder.”
“It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in
Summer Street. It would be _death_ to gossip about Mr. Vyse’s dismissal
at the present moment.”
Mr. Beebe raised his eyebrows. Death is a strong word—surely too
strong. There was no question of tragedy. He said: “Of course, Miss
Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she
chooses. Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.”
“I know,” said Miss Bartlett civilly. “Yet Freddy ought not to have
told even you. One cannot be too careful.”
“Quite so.”
“I do implore absolute secrecy. A chance word to a chattering friend,
and—”
“Exactly.” He was used to these nervous old maids and to the
exaggerated importance that they attach to words. A rector lives in a
web of petty secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is
the less he will regard them. He will change the subject, as did Mr.
Beebe, saying cheerfully: “Have you heard from any Bertolini people
lately? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish. It is odd how we of
that pension, who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been
working into one another’s lives. Two, three, four, six of us—no,
eight; I had forgotten the Emersons—have kept more or less in touch. We
must really give the Signora a testimonial.”
And, Miss Bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in
a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern. On the
summit they paused. The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last
hour, giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey.
Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and
shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there
gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue. Summer was retreating. The
wind roared, the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for
those vast operations in heaven. The weather was breaking up, breaking,
broken, and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural
that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. Mr.
Beebe’s eyes rested on Windy Corner, where Lucy sat, practising Mozart.
No smile came to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said:
“We shan’t have rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on.
The darkness last night was appalling.”
They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o’clock. That amiable
hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do
dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant
sanded room, and have tea at a table comfortably. Mr. Beebe saw that
Miss Bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that Minnie would be
dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. They would
hand the child her food through the window. Thus he was incidentally
enabled to discuss the fortunes of Lucy.
“I have been thinking, Miss Bartlett,” he said, “and, unless you very
much object, I would like to reopen that discussion.” She bowed.
“Nothing about the past. I know little and care less about that; I am
absolutely certain that it is to your cousin’s credit. She has acted
loftily and rightly, and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we
think too highly of her. But the future. Seriously, what do you think
of this Greek plan?” He pulled out the letter again. “I don’t know
whether you overheard, but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their
mad career. It’s all—I can’t explain—it’s wrong.”
Miss Bartlett read the letter in silence, laid it down, seemed to
hesitate, and then read it again.
“I can’t see the point of it myself.”
To his astonishment, she replied: “There I cannot agree with you. In it
I spy Lucy’s salvation.”
“Really. Now, why?”
“She wanted to leave Windy Corner.”
“I know—but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so—I was going to
say—selfish.”
“It is natural, surely—after such painful scenes—that she should desire
a change.”
Here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect
misses. Mr. Beebe exclaimed: “So she says herself, and since another
lady agrees with her, I must own that I am partially convinced. Perhaps
she must have a change. I have no sisters or—and I don’t understand
these things. But why need she go as far as Greece?”
“You may well ask that,” replied Miss Bartlett, who was evidently
interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. “Why Greece?
(What is it, Minnie dear—jam?) Why not Tunbridge Wells? Oh, Mr. Beebe!
I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this
morning. I cannot help her. I will say no more. Perhaps I have already
said too much. I am not to talk. I wanted her to spend six months with
me at Tunbridge Wells, and she refused.”
Mr. Beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.
“But my feelings are of no importance. I know too well that I get on
Lucy’s nerves. Our tour was a failure. She wanted to leave Florence,
and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome, and all the
time I felt that I was spending her mother’s money—.”
“Let us keep to the future, though,” interrupted Mr. Beebe. “I want
your advice.”
“Very well,” said Charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to
him, though familiar to Lucy. “I for one will help her to go to Greece.
Will you?”
Mr. Beebe considered.
“It is absolutely necessary,” she continued, lowering her veil and
whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
“I know—I _know_.” The darkness was coming on, and he felt that this
odd woman really did know. “She must not stop here a moment, and we
must keep quiet till she goes. I trust that the servants know nothing.
Afterwards—but I may have said too much already. Only, Lucy and I are
helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone. If you help we may succeed.
Otherwise—”
“Otherwise—?”
“Otherwise,” she repeated as if the word held finality.
“Yes, I will help her,” said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm.
“Come, let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.”
Miss Bartlett burst into florid gratitude. The tavern sign—a beehive
trimmed evenly with bees—creaked in the wind outside as she thanked
him. Mr. Beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did
not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of “another
man” that would have attracted a grosser mind. He only felt that Miss
Bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be
delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. Its
very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry. His belief in
celibacy, so reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and
culture, now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate
flower. “They that marry do well, but they that refrain do better.” So
ran his belief, and he never heard that an engagement was broken off
but with a slight feeling of pleasure. In the case of Lucy, the feeling
was intensified through dislike of Cecil; and he was willing to go
further—to place her out of danger until she could confirm her
resolution of virginity. The feeling was very subtle and quite
undogmatic, and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in
this entanglement. Yet it existed, and it alone explains his action
subsequently, and his influence on the action of others. The compact
that he made with Miss Bartlett in the tavern, was to help not only
Lucy, but religion also.
They hurried home through a world of black and grey. He conversed on
indifferent topics: the Emersons’ need of a housekeeper; servants;
Italian servants; novels about Italy; novels with a purpose; could
literature influence life? Windy Corner glimmered. In the garden, Mrs.
Honeychurch, now helped by Freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her
flowers.
“It gets too dark,” she said hopelessly. “This comes of putting off. We
might have known the weather would break up soon; and now Lucy wants to
go to Greece. I don’t know what the world’s coming to.”
“Mrs. Honeychurch,” he said, “go to Greece she must. Come up to the
house and let’s talk it over. Do you, in the first place, mind her
breaking with Vyse?”
“Mr. Beebe, I’m thankful—simply thankful.”
“So am I,” said Freddy.
“Good. Now come up to the house.”
They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.
Lucy would never have carried the Greek scheme alone. It was expensive
and dramatic—both qualities that her mother loathed. Nor would
Charlotte have succeeded. The honours of the day rested with Mr. Beebe.
By his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman—for a
clergyman who was not a fool influenced Mrs. Honeychurch greatly—he
bent her to their purpose, “I don’t see why Greece is necessary,” she
said; “but as you do, I suppose it is all right. It must be something I
can’t understand. Lucy! Let’s tell her. Lucy!”
“She is playing the piano,” Mr. Beebe said. He opened the door, and
heard the words of a song:
“Look not thou on beauty’s charming.”
“I didn’t know that Miss Honeychurch sang, too.”
“Sit thou still when kings are arming,
Taste not when the wine-cup glistens——”
“It’s a song that Cecil gave her. How odd girls are!”
“What’s that?” called Lucy, stopping short.
“All right, dear,” said Mrs. Honeychurch kindly. She went into the
drawing-room, and Mr. Beebe heard her kiss Lucy and say: “I am sorry I
was so cross about Greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.”
Rather a hard voice said: “Thank you, mother; that doesn’t matter a
bit.”
“And you are right, too—Greece will be all right; you can go if the
Miss Alans will have you.”
“Oh, splendid! Oh, thank you!”
Mr. Beebe followed. Lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the
keys. She was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. Her mother
bent over her. Freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the
floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
Oddly enough, the group was beautiful. Mr. Beebe, who loved the art of
the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the _Santa Conversazione_,
in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together
about noble things—a theme neither sensual nor sensational, and
therefore ignored by the art of to-day. Why should Lucy want either to
marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?
“Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,
Speak not when the people listens,”
she continued.
“Here’s Mr. Beebe.”
“Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways.”
“It’s a beautiful song and a wise one,” said he. “Go on.”
“It isn’t very good,” she said listlessly. “I forget why—harmony or
something.”
“I suspected it was unscholarly. It’s so beautiful.”
“The tune’s right enough,” said Freddy, “but the words are rotten. Why
throw up the sponge?”
“How stupidly you talk!” said his sister. The _Santa Conversazione_ was
broken up. After all, there was no reason that Lucy should talk about
Greece or thank him for persuading her mother, so he said good-bye.
Freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual
felicity of phrase, said: “This has been a day and a half.”
“Stop thine ear against the singer—”
“Wait a minute; she is finishing.”
“From the red gold keep thy finger;
Vacant heart and hand and eye
Easy live and quiet die.”
“I love weather like this,” said Freddy.
Mr. Beebe passed into it.
The two main facts were clear. She had behaved splendidly, and he had
helped her. He could not expect to master the details of so big a
change in a girl’s life. If here and there he was dissatisfied or
puzzled, he must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.
“Vacant heart and hand and eye—”
Perhaps the song stated “the better part” rather too strongly. He half
fancied that the soaring accompaniment—which he did not lose in the
shout of the gale—really agreed with Freddy, and was gently criticizing
the words that it adorned:
“Vacant heart and hand and eye
Easy live and quiet die.”
However, for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him—now as a
beacon in the roaring tides of darkness.
Chapter XIX
Lying to Mr. Emerson
The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near
Bloomsbury—a clean, airless establishment much patronized by provincial
England. They always perched there before crossing the great seas, and
for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes, guide-books,
mackintosh squares, digestive bread, and other Continental necessaries.
That there are shops abroad, even in Athens, never occurred to them,
for they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken
by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores. Miss
Honeychurch, they trusted, would take care to equip herself duly.
Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help
towards freshening up one’s face in the train. Lucy promised, a little
depressed.
“But, of course, you know all about these things, and you have Mr. Vyse
to help you. A gentleman is such a stand-by.”
Mrs. Honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to
drum nervously upon her card-case.
“We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you,” Miss Catharine
continued. “It is not every young man who would be so unselfish. But
perhaps he will come out and join you later on.”
“Or does his work keep him in London?” said Miss Teresa, the more acute
and less kindly of the two sisters.
“However, we shall see him when he sees you off. I do so long to see
him.”
“No one will see Lucy off,” interposed Mrs. Honeychurch. “She doesn’t
like it.”
“No, I hate seeings-off,” said Lucy.
“Really? How funny! I should have thought that in this case—”
“Oh, Mrs. Honeychurch, you aren’t going? It is such a pleasure to have
met you!”
They escaped, and Lucy said with relief: “That’s all right. We just got
through that time.”
But her mother was annoyed. “I should be told, dear, that I am
unsympathetic. But I cannot see why you didn’t tell your friends about
Cecil and be done with it. There all the time we had to sit fencing,
and almost telling lies, and be seen through, too, I dare say, which is
most unpleasant.”
Lucy had plenty to say in reply. She described the Miss Alans’
character: they were such gossips, and if one told them, the news would
be everywhere in no time.
“But why shouldn’t it be everywhere in no time?”
“Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England.
I shall tell them then. It’s much pleasanter. How wet it is! Let’s turn
in here.”
“Here” was the British Museum. Mrs. Honeychurch refused. If they must
take shelter, let it be in a shop. Lucy felt contemptuous, for she was
on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a
mythical dictionary from Mr. Beebe to get up the names of the goddesses
and gods.
“Oh, well, let it be shop, then. Let’s go to Mudie’s. I’ll buy a
guide-book.”
“You know, Lucy, you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I’m so
stupid, so I suppose I am, but I shall never understand this
hole-and-corner work. You’ve got rid of Cecil—well and good, and I’m
thankful he’s gone, though I did feel angry for the minute. But why not
announce it? Why this hushing up and tip-toeing?”
“It’s only for a few days.”
“But why at all?”
Lucy was silent. She was drifting away from her mother. It was quite
easy to say, “Because George Emerson has been bothering me, and if he
hears I’ve given up Cecil may begin again”—quite easy, and it had the
incidental advantage of being true. But she could not say it. She
disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that
king of terrors—Light. Ever since that last evening at Florence she had
deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.
Mrs. Honeychurch, too, was silent. She was thinking, “My daughter won’t
answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than
with Freddy and me. Any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she
can leave her home.” And as in her case thoughts never remained
unspoken long, she burst out with: “You’re tired of Windy Corner.”
This was perfectly true. Lucy had hoped to return to Windy Corner when
she escaped from Cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no
longer. It might exist for Freddy, who still lived and thought
straight, but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain. She
did not acknowledge that her brain was warped, for the brain itself
must assist in that acknowledgment, and she was disordering the very
instruments of life. She only felt, “I do not love George; I broke off
my engagement because I did not love George; I must go to Greece
because I do not love George; it is more important that I should look
up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother; everyone
else is behaving very badly.” She only felt irritable and petulant, and
anxious to do what she was not expected to do, and in this spirit she
proceeded with the conversation.
“Oh, mother, what rubbish you talk! Of course I’m not tired of Windy
Corner.”
“Then why not say so at once, instead of considering half an hour?”
She laughed faintly, “Half a _minute_ would be nearer.”
“Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether?”
“Hush, mother! People will hear you”; for they had entered Mudie’s. She
bought Baedeker, and then continued: “Of course I want to live at home;
but as we are talking about it, I may as well say that I shall want to
be away in the future more than I have been. You see, I come into my
money next year.”
Tears came into her mother’s eyes.
Driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed
“eccentricity,” Lucy determined to make this point clear. “I’ve seen
the world so little—I felt so out of things in Italy. I have seen so
little of life; one ought to come up to London more—not a cheap ticket
like to-day, but to stop. I might even share a flat for a little with
some other girl.”
“And mess with typewriters and latch-keys,” exploded Mrs. Honeychurch.
“And agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police. And
call it a Mission—when no one wants you! And call it Duty—when it means
that you can’t stand your own home! And call it Work—when thousands of
men are starving with the competition as it is! And then to prepare
yourself, find two doddering old ladies, and go abroad with them.”
“I want more independence,” said Lucy lamely; she knew that she wanted
something, and independence is a useful cry; we can always say that we
have not got it. She tried to remember her emotions in Florence: those
had been sincere and passionate, and had suggested beauty rather than
short skirts and latch-keys. But independence was certainly her cue.
“Very well. Take your independence and be gone. Rush up and down and
round the world, and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food.
Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he
planted, and our dear view—and then share a flat with another girl.”
Lucy screwed up her mouth and said: “Perhaps I spoke hastily.”
“Oh, goodness!” her mother flashed. “How you do remind me of Charlotte
Bartlett!”
“_Charlotte?_” flashed Lucy in her turn, pierced at last by a vivid
pain.
“More every moment.”
“I don’t know what you mean, mother; Charlotte and I are not the very
least alike.”
“Well, I see the likeness. The same eternal worrying, the same taking
back of words. You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among
three people last night might be sisters.”
“What rubbish! And if you dislike Charlotte so, it’s rather a pity you
asked her to stop. I warned you about her; I begged you, implored you
not to, but of course it was not listened to.”
“There you go.”
“I beg your pardon?”
“Charlotte again, my dear; that’s all; her very words.”
Lucy clenched her teeth. “My point is that you oughtn’t to have asked
Charlotte to stop. I wish you would keep to the point.” And the
conversation died off into a wrangle.
She and her mother shopped in silence, spoke little in the train,
little again in the carriage, which met them at Dorking Station. It had
poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes
showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on
the hood. Lucy complained that the hood was stuffy. Leaning forward,
she looked out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp
pass like a search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing
beautiful. “The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable,” she
remarked. For they were to pick up Miss Bartlett at Summer Street,
where she had been dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on
Mr. Beebe’s old mother. “We shall have to sit three a side, because the
trees drop, and yet it isn’t raining. Oh, for a little air!” Then she
listened to the horse’s hoofs—“He has not told—he has not told.” That
melody was blurred by the soft road. “_Can’t_ we have the hood down?”
she demanded, and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: “Very well,
old lady, stop the horse.” And the horse was stopped, and Lucy and
Powell wrestled with the hood, and squirted water down Mrs.
Honeychurch’s neck. But now that the hood was down, she did see
something that she would have missed—there were no lights in the
windows of Cissie Villa, and round the garden gate she fancied she saw
a padlock.
“Is that house to let again, Powell?” she called.
“Yes, miss,” he replied.
“Have they gone?”
“It is too far out of town for the young gentleman, and his father’s
rheumatism has come on, so he can’t stop on alone, so they are trying
to let furnished,” was the answer.
“They have gone, then?”
“Yes, miss, they have gone.”
Lucy sank back. The carriage stopped at the Rectory. She got out to
call for Miss Bartlett. So the Emersons had gone, and all this bother
about Greece had been unnecessary. Waste! That word seemed to sum up
the whole of life. Wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had
wounded her mother. Was it possible that she had muddled things away?
Quite possible. Other people had. When the maid opened the door, she
was unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.
Miss Bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked a
great favour: might she go to church? Mr. Beebe and his mother had
already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her
hostess’s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a
good ten minutes more.
“Certainly,” said the hostess wearily. “I forgot it was Friday. Let’s
all go. Powell can go round to the stables.”
“Lucy dearest—”
“No church for me, thank you.”
A sigh, and they departed. The church was invisible, but up in the
darkness to the left there was a hint of colour. This was a stained
window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door
opened Lucy heard Mr. Beebe’s voice running through the litany to a
minute congregation. Even their church, built upon the slope of the
hill so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of
silvery shingle—even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one
never talked about—religion—was fading like all the other things.
She followed the maid into the Rectory.
Would she object to sitting in Mr. Beebe’s study? There was only that
one fire.
She would not object.
Some one was there already, for Lucy heard the words: “A lady to wait,
sir.”
Old Mr. Emerson was sitting by the fire, with his foot upon a
gout-stool.
“Oh, Miss Honeychurch, that you should come!” he quavered; and Lucy saw
an alteration in him since last Sunday.
Not a word would come to her lips. George she had faced, and could have
faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.
“Miss Honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry! George is so sorry! He
thought he had a right to try. I cannot blame my boy, and yet I wish he
had told me first. He ought not to have tried. I knew nothing about it
at all.”
If only she could remember how to behave!
He held up his hand. “But you must not scold him.”
Lucy turned her back, and began to look at Mr. Beebe’s books.
“I taught him,” he quavered, “to trust in love. I said: ‘When love
comes, that is reality.’ I said: ‘Passion does not blind. No. Passion
is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever
really understand.’” He sighed: “True, everlastingly true, though my
day is over, and though there is the result. Poor boy! He is so sorry!
He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that
whatever you felt you did not mean. Yet”—his voice gathered strength:
he spoke out to make certain—“Miss Honeychurch, do you remember Italy?”
Lucy selected a book—a volume of Old Testament commentaries. Holding it
up to her eyes, she said: “I have no wish to discuss Italy or any
subject connected with your son.”
“But you do remember it?”
“He has misbehaved himself from the first.”
“I only was told that he loved you last Sunday. I never could judge
behaviour. I—I—suppose he has.”
Feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to
him. His face was drooping and swollen, but his eyes, though they were
sunken deep, gleamed with a child’s courage.
“Why, he has behaved abominably,” she said. “I am glad he is sorry. Do
you know what he did?”
“Not ‘abominably,’” was the gentle correction. “He only tried when he
should not have tried. You have all you want, Miss Honeychurch: you are
going to marry the man you love. Do not go out of George’s life saying
he is abominable.”
“No, of course,” said Lucy, ashamed at the reference to Cecil.
“‘Abominable’ is much too strong. I am sorry I used it about your son.
I think I will go to church, after all. My mother and my cousin have
gone. I shall not be so very late—”
“Especially as he has gone under,” he said quietly.
“What was that?”
“Gone under naturally.” He beat his palms together in silence; his head
fell on his chest.
“I don’t understand.”
“As his mother did.”
“But, Mr. Emerson—_Mr. Emerson_—what are you talking about?”
“When I wouldn’t have George baptized,” said he.
Lucy was frightened.
“And she agreed that baptism was nothing, but he caught that fever when
he was twelve and she turned round. She thought it a judgement.” He
shuddered. “Oh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and
broken away from her parents. Oh, horrible—worst of all—worse than
death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted
your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in
again! A judgement! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had
dropped water on him in church! Is it possible, Miss Honeychurch? Shall
we slip back into the darkness for ever?”
“I don’t know,” gasped Lucy. “I don’t understand this sort of thing. I
was not meant to understand it.”
“But Mr. Eager—he came when I was out, and acted according to his
principles. I don’t blame him or any one... but by the time George was
well she was ill. He made her think about sin, and she went under
thinking about it.”
It was thus that Mr. Emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of God.
“Oh, how terrible!” said Lucy, forgetting her own affairs at last.
“He was not baptized,” said the old man. “I did hold firm.” And he
looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books, as if—at what
cost!—he had won a victory over them. “My boy shall go back to the
earth untouched.”
She asked whether young Mr. Emerson was ill.
“Oh—last Sunday.” He started into the present. “George last Sunday—no,
not ill: just gone under. He is never ill. But he is his mother’s son.
Her eyes were his, and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful,
and he will not think it worth while to live. It was always touch and
go. He will live; but he will not think it worth while to live. He will
never think anything worth while. You remember that church at
Florence?”
Lucy did remember, and how she had suggested that George should collect
postage stamps.
“After you left Florence—horrible. Then we took the house here, and he
goes bathing with your brother, and became better. You saw him
bathing?”
“I am so sorry, but it is no good discussing this affair. I am deeply
sorry about it.”
“Then there came something about a novel. I didn’t follow it at all; I
had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old. Ah,
well, one must have failures. George comes down to-morrow, and takes me
up to his London rooms. He can’t bear to be about here, and I must be
where he is.”
“Mr. Emerson,” cried the girl, “don’t leave at least, not on my
account. I am going to Greece. Don’t leave your comfortable house.”
It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled. “How good
everyone is! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me—came over this morning
and heard I was going! Here I am so comfortable with a fire.”
“Yes, but you won’t go back to London. It’s absurd.”
“I must be with George; I must make him care to live, and down here he
can’t. He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you—I am
not justifying him: I am only saying what has happened.”
“Oh, Mr. Emerson”—she took hold of his hand—“you mustn’t. I’ve been
bother enough to the world by now. I can’t have you moving out of your
house when you like it, and perhaps losing money through it—all on my
account. You must stop! I am just going to Greece.”
“All the way to Greece?”
Her manner altered.
“To Greece?”
“So you must stop. You won’t talk about this business, I know. I can
trust you both.”
“Certainly you can. We either have you in our lives, or leave you to
the life that you have chosen.”
“I shouldn’t want—”
“I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George? No, it was wrong of
George to try. We have pushed our beliefs too far. I fancy that we
deserve sorrow.”
She looked at the books again—black, brown, and that acrid theological
blue. They surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on
the tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. To Lucy who could
not see that Mr. Emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from
Mr. Beebe chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion—it seemed dreadful
that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy,
and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.
More certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.
“No, please sit still. I think I will sit in the carriage.”
“Miss Honeychurch, you do sound tired.”
“Not a bit,” said Lucy, with trembling lips.
“But you are, and there’s a look of George about you. And what were you
saying about going abroad?”
She was silent.
“Greece”—and she saw that he was thinking the word over—“Greece; but
you were to be married this year, I thought.”
“Not till January, it wasn’t,” said Lucy, clasping her hands. Would she
tell an actual lie when it came to the point?
“I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you. I hope—it isn’t because
George spoke that you are both going?”
“No.”
“I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse.”
“Thank you.”
At that moment Mr. Beebe came back from church. His cassock was covered
with rain. “That’s all right,” he said kindly. “I counted on you two
keeping each other company. It’s pouring again. The entire
congregation, which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my
mother, stands waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. Did
Powell go round?”
“I think so; I’ll see.”
“No—of course, I’ll see. How are the Miss Alans?”
“Very well, thank you.”
“Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece?”
“I—I did.”
“Don’t you think it very plucky of her, Mr. Emerson, to undertake the
two Miss Alans? Now, Miss Honeychurch, go back—keep warm. I think three
is such a courageous number to go travelling.” And he hurried off to
the stables.
“He is not going,” she said hoarsely. “I made a slip. Mr. Vyse does
stop behind in England.”
Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man. To George, to Cecil,
she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so
dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account,
and the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the rough paths
that he had traversed, that the true chivalry—not the worn-out chivalry
of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the
old—awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that Cecil was
not her companion to Greece. And she spoke so seriously that the risk
became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: “You are leaving
him? You are leaving the man you love?”
“I—I had to.”
“Why, Miss Honeychurch, why?”
Terror came over her, and she lied again. She made the long, convincing
speech that she had made to Mr. Beebe, and intended to make to the
world when she announced that her engagement was no more. He heard her
in silence, and then said: “My dear, I am worried about you. It seems
to me”—dreamily; she was not alarmed—“that you are in a muddle.”
She shook her head.
“Take an old man’s word; there’s nothing worse than a muddle in all the
world. It is easy to face Death and Fate, and the things that sound so
dreadful. It is on my muddles that I look back with horror—on the
things that I might have avoided. We can help one another but little. I
used to think I could teach young people the whole of life, but I know
better now, and all my teaching of George has come down to this: beware
of muddle. Do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be
annoyed with me and weren’t? Do you remember before, when you refused
the room with the view? Those were muddles—little, but ominous—and I am
fearing that you are in one now.” She was silent. “Don’t trust me, Miss
Honeychurch. Though life is very glorious, it is difficult.” She was
still silent. “‘Life’ wrote a friend of mine, ‘is a public performance
on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you go along.’
I think he puts it well. Man has to pick up the use of his functions as
he goes along—especially the function of Love.” Then he burst out
excitedly; “That’s it; that’s what I mean. You love George!” And after
his long preamble, the three words burst against Lucy like waves from
the open sea.
“But you do,” he went on, not waiting for contradiction. “You love the
boy body and soul, plainly, directly, as he loves you, and no other
word expresses it. You won’t marry the other man for his sake.”
“How dare you!” gasped Lucy, with the roaring of waters in her ears.
“Oh, how like a man!—I mean, to suppose that a woman is always thinking
about a man.”
“But you are.”
She summoned physical disgust.
“You’re shocked, but I mean to shock you. It’s the only hope at times.
I can reach you no other way. You must marry, or your life will be
wasted. You have gone too far to retreat. I have no time for the
tenderness, and the comradeship, and the poetry, and the things that
really matter, and _for which_ you marry. I know that, with George, you
will find them, and that you love him. Then be his wife. He is already
part of you. Though you fly to Greece, and never see him again, or
forget his very name, George will work in your thoughts till you die.
It isn’t possible to love and to part. You will wish that it was. You
can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out
of you. I know by experience that the poets are right: love is
eternal.”
Lucy began to cry with anger, and though her anger passed away soon,
her tears remained.
“I only wish poets would say this, too: love is of the body; not the
body, but of the body. Ah! the misery that would be saved if we
confessed that! Ah! for a little directness to liberate the soul! Your
soul, dear Lucy! I hate the word now, because of all the cant with
which superstition has wrapped it round. But we have souls. I cannot
say how they came nor whither they go, but we have them, and I see you
ruining yours. I cannot bear it. It is again the darkness creeping in;
it is hell.” Then he checked himself. “What nonsense I have talked—how
abstract and remote! And I have made you cry! Dear girl, forgive my
prosiness; marry my boy. When I think what life is, and how seldom love
is answered by love—Marry him; it is one of the moments for which the
world was made.”
She could not understand him; the words were indeed remote. Yet as he
spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the
bottom of her soul.
“Then, Lucy—”
“You’ve frightened me,” she moaned. “Cecil—Mr. Beebe—the ticket’s
bought—everything.” She fell sobbing into the chair. “I’m caught in the
tangle. I must suffer and grow old away from him. I cannot break the
whole of life for his sake. They trusted me.”
A carriage drew up at the front-door.
“Give George my love—once only. Tell him ‘muddle.’” Then she arranged
her veil, while the tears poured over her cheeks inside.
“Lucy—”
“No—they are in the hall—oh, please not, Mr. Emerson—they trust me—”
“But why should they, when you have deceived them?”
Mr. Beebe opened the door, saying: “Here’s my mother.”
“You’re not worthy of their trust.”
“What’s that?” said Mr. Beebe sharply.
“I was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?”
“One minute, mother.” He came in and shut the door.
“I don’t follow you, Mr. Emerson. To whom do you refer? Trust whom?”
“I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George. They
have loved one another all along.”
Mr. Beebe looked at the sobbing girl. He was very quiet, and his white
face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. A long black
column, he stood and awaited her reply.
“I shall never marry him,” quavered Lucy.
A look of contempt came over him, and he said, “Why not?”
“Mr. Beebe—I have misled you—I have misled myself—”
“Oh, rubbish, Miss Honeychurch!”
“It is not rubbish!” said the old man hotly. “It’s the part of people
that you don’t understand.”
Mr. Beebe laid his hand on the old man’s shoulder pleasantly.
“Lucy! Lucy!” called voices from the carriage.
“Mr. Beebe, could you help me?”
He looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: “I am
more grieved than I can possibly express. It is lamentable,
lamentable—incredible.”
“What’s wrong with the boy?” fired up the other again.
“Nothing, Mr. Emerson, except that he no longer interests me. Marry
George, Miss Honeychurch. He will do admirably.”
He walked out and left them. They heard him guiding his mother
up-stairs.
“Lucy!” the voices called.
She turned to Mr. Emerson in despair. But his face revived her. It was
the face of a saint who understood.
“Now it is all dark. Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed.
I know. But remember the mountains over Florence and the view. Ah,
dear, if I were George, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave.
You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth, out into the
muddle that you have made yourself; and your mother and all your
friends will despise you, oh, my darling, and rightly, if it is ever
right to despise. George still dark, all the tussle and the misery
without a word from him. Am I justified?” Into his own eyes tears came.
“Yes, for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure; there is Truth.
Truth counts, Truth does count.”
“You kiss me,” said the girl. “You kiss me. I will try.”
He gave her a sense of deities reconciled, a feeling that, in gaining
the man she loved, she would gain something for the whole world.
Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive—she spoke at once—his
salutation remained. He had robbed the body of its taint, the world’s
taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.
She “never exactly understood,” she would say in after years, “how he
managed to strengthen her. It was as if he had made her see the whole
of everything at once.”
Chapter XX
The End of the Middle Ages
The Miss Alans did go to Greece, but they went by themselves. They
alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of
the Saronic gulf. They alone will visit Athens and Delphi, and either
shrine of intellectual song—that upon the Acropolis, encircled by blue
seas; that under Parnassus, where the eagles build and the bronze
charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity. Trembling, anxious,
cumbered with much digestive bread, they did proceed to Constantinople,
they did go round the world. The rest of us must be contented with a
fair, but a less arduous, goal. Italiam petimus: we return to the
Pension Bertolini.
George said it was his old room.
“No, it isn’t,” said Lucy; “because it is the room I had, and I had
your father’s room. I forget why; Charlotte made me, for some reason.”
He knelt on the tiled floor, and laid his face in her lap.
“George, you baby, get up.”
“Why shouldn’t I be a baby?” murmured George.
Unable to answer this question, she put down his sock, which she was
trying to mend, and gazed out through the window. It was evening and
again the spring.
“Oh, bother Charlotte,” she said thoughtfully. “What can such people be
made of?”
“Same stuff as parsons are made of.”
“Nonsense!”
“Quite right. It is nonsense.”
“Now you get up off the cold floor, or you’ll be starting rheumatism
next, and you stop laughing and being so silly.”
“Why shouldn’t I laugh?” he asked, pinning her with his elbows, and
advancing his face to hers. “What’s there to cry at? Kiss me here.” He
indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome.
He was a boy after all. When it came to the point, it was she who
remembered the past, she into whose soul the iron had entered, she who
knew whose room this had been last year. It endeared him to her
strangely that he should be sometimes wrong.
“Any letters?” he asked.
“Just a line from Freddy.”
“Now kiss me here; then here.”
Then, threatened again with rheumatism, he strolled to the window,
opened it (as the English will), and leant out. There was the parapet,
there the river, there to the left the beginnings of the hills. The
cab-driver, who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent, might
be that very Phaethon who had set this happiness in motion twelve
months ago. A passion of gratitude—all feelings grow to passions in the
South—came over the husband, and he blessed the people and the things
who had taken so much trouble about a young fool. He had helped
himself, it is true, but how stupidly!
All the fighting that mattered had been done by others—by Italy, by his
father, by his wife.
“Lucy, you come and look at the cypresses; and the church, whatever its
name is, still shows.”
“San Miniato. I’ll just finish your sock.”
“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro,” called the cabman, with engaging
certainty.
George told him that he was mistaken; they had no money to throw away
on driving.
And the people who had not meant to help—the Miss Lavishes, the Cecils,
the Miss Bartletts! Ever prone to magnify Fate, George counted up the
forces that had swept him into this contentment.
“Anything good in Freddy’s letter?”
“Not yet.”
His own content was absolute, but hers held bitterness: the
Honeychurches had not forgiven them; they were disgusted at her past
hypocrisy; she had alienated Windy Corner, perhaps for ever.
“What does he say?”
“Silly boy! He thinks he’s being dignified. He knew we should go off in
the spring—he has known it for six months—that if mother wouldn’t give
her consent we should take the thing into our own hands. They had fair
warning, and now he calls it an elopement. Ridiculous boy—”
“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—”
“But it will all come right in the end. He has to build us both up from
the beginning again. I wish, though, that Cecil had not turned so
cynical about women. He has, for the second time, quite altered. Why
will men have theories about women? I haven’t any about men. I wish,
too, that Mr. Beebe—”
“You may well wish that.”
“He will never forgive us—I mean, he will never be interested in us
again. I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner. I
wish he hadn’t—But if we act the truth, the people who really love us
are sure to come back to us in the long run.”
“Perhaps.” Then he said more gently: “Well, I acted the truth—the only
thing I did do—and you came back to me. So possibly you know.” He
turned back into the room. “Nonsense with that sock.” He carried her to
the window, so that she, too, saw all the view. They sank upon their
knees, invisible from the road, they hoped, and began to whisper one
another’s names. Ah! it was worth while; it was the great joy that they
had expected, and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt.
They were silent.
“Signorino, domani faremo—”
“Oh, bother that man!”
But Lucy remembered the vendor of photographs and said, “No, don’t be
rude to him.” Then with a catching of her breath, she murmured: “Mr.
Eager and Charlotte, dreadful frozen Charlotte. How cruel she would be
to a man like that!”
“Look at the lights going over the bridge.”
“But this room reminds me of Charlotte. How horrible to grow old in
Charlotte’s way! To think that evening at the rectory that she
shouldn’t have heard your father was in the house. For she would have
stopped me going in, and he was the only person alive who could have
made me see sense. You couldn’t have made me. When I am very happy”—she
kissed him—“I remember on how little it all hangs. If Charlotte had
only known, she would have stopped me going in, and I should have gone
to silly Greece, and become different for ever.”
“But she did know,” said George; “she did see my father, surely. He
said so.”
“Oh, no, she didn’t see him. She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe,
don’t you remember, and then went straight to the church. She said so.”
George was obstinate again. “My father,” said he, “saw her, and I
prefer his word. He was dozing by the study fire, and he opened his
eyes, and there was Miss Bartlett. A few minutes before you came in.
She was turning to go as he woke up. He didn’t speak to her.”
Then they spoke of other things—the desultory talk of those who have
been fighting to reach one another, and whose reward is to rest quietly
in each other’s arms. It was long ere they returned to Miss Bartlett,
but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting. George, who
disliked any darkness, said: “It’s clear that she knew. Then, why did
she risk the meeting? She knew he was there, and yet she went to
church.”
They tried to piece the thing together.
As they talked, an incredible solution came into Lucy’s mind. She
rejected it, and said: “How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble
muddle at the last moment.” But something in the dying evening, in the
roar of the river, in their very embrace warned them that her words
fell short of life, and George whispered: “Or did she mean it?”
“Mean what?”
“Signorino, domani faremo uno giro—”
Lucy bent forward and said with gentleness: “Lascia, prego, lascia.
Siamo sposati.”
“Scusi tanto, signora,” he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up
his horse.
“Buona sera—e grazie.”
“Niente.”
The cabman drove away singing.
“Mean what, George?”
He whispered: “Is it this? Is this possible? I’ll put a marvel to you.
That your cousin has always hoped. That from the very first moment we
met, she hoped, far down in her mind, that we should be like this—of
course, very far down. That she fought us on the surface, and yet she
hoped. I can’t explain her any other way. Can you? Look how she kept me
alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after
month she became more eccentric and unreliable. The sight of us haunted
her—or she couldn’t have described us as she did to her friend. There
are details—it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen,
Lucy, she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but
in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us
happy. We can never make friends with her or thank her. But I do
believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and
behaviour, she is glad.”
“It is impossible,” murmured Lucy, and then, remembering the
experiences of her own heart, she said: “No—it is just possible.”
Youth enwrapped them; the song of Phaethon announced passion requited,
love attained. But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than
this. The song died away; they heard the river, bearing down the snows
of winter into the Mediterranean.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PRELUDE.
Who that cares much to know the history of man, and how the mysterious
mixture behaves under the varying experiments of Time, has not dwelt,
at least briefly, on the life of Saint Theresa, has not smiled with
some gentleness at the thought of the little girl walking forth one
morning hand-in-hand with her still smaller brother, to go and seek
martyrdom in the country of the Moors? Out they toddled from rugged
Avila, wide-eyed and helpless-looking as two fawns, but with human
hearts, already beating to a national idea; until domestic reality met
them in the shape of uncles, and turned them back from their great
resolve. That child-pilgrimage was a fit beginning. Theresa’s
passionate, ideal nature demanded an epic life: what were many-volumed
romances of chivalry and the social conquests of a brilliant girl to
her? Her flame quickly burned up that light fuel; and, fed from within,
soared after some illimitable satisfaction, some object which would
never justify weariness, which would reconcile self-despair with the
rapturous consciousness of life beyond self. She found her epos in the
reform of a religious order.
That Spanish woman who lived three hundred years ago, was certainly not
the last of her kind. Many Theresas have been born who found for
themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of
far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of
a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of
opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and
sank unwept into oblivion. With dim lights and tangled circumstance
they tried to shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but
after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and
formlessness; for these later-born Theresas were helped by no coherent
social faith and order which could perform the function of knowledge
for the ardently willing soul. Their ardor alternated between a vague
ideal and the common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was
disapproved as extravagance, and the other condemned as a lapse.
Some have felt that these blundering lives are due to the inconvenient
indefiniteness with which the Supreme Power has fashioned the natures
of women: if there were one level of feminine incompetence as strict as
the ability to count three and no more, the social lot of women might
be treated with scientific certitude. Meanwhile the indefiniteness
remains, and the limits of variation are really much wider than any one
would imagine from the sameness of women’s coiffure and the favorite
love-stories in prose and verse. Here and there a cygnet is reared
uneasily among the ducklings in the brown pond, and never finds the
living stream in fellowship with its own oary-footed kind. Here and
there is born a Saint Theresa, foundress of nothing, whose loving
heart-beats and sobs after an unattained goodness tremble off and are
dispersed among hindrances, instead of centring in some
long-recognizable deed.

MISS BROOKE.
CHAPTER I.
Since I can do no good because a woman,
Reach constantly at something that is near it.
—_The Maid’s Tragedy:_ BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER.
Miss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into
relief by poor dress. Her hand and wrist were so finely formed that she
could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the
Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters; and her profile as well as
her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain
garments, which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the
impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible,—or from one of our
elder poets,—in a paragraph of to-day’s newspaper. She was usually
spoken of as being remarkably clever, but with the addition that her
sister Celia had more common-sense. Nevertheless, Celia wore scarcely
more trimmings; and it was only to close observers that her dress
differed from her sister’s, and had a shade of coquetry in its
arrangements; for Miss Brooke’s plain dressing was due to mixed
conditions, in most of which her sister shared. The pride of being
ladies had something to do with it: the Brooke connections, though not
exactly aristocratic, were unquestionably “good:” if you inquired
backward for a generation or two, you would not find any yard-measuring
or parcel-tying forefathers—anything lower than an admiral or a
clergyman; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan
gentleman who served under Cromwell, but afterwards conformed, and
managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a
respectable family estate. Young women of such birth, living in a quiet
country-house, and attending a village church hardly larger than a
parlor, naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster’s
daughter. Then there was well-bred economy, which in those days made
show in dress the first item to be deducted from, when any margin was
required for expenses more distinctive of rank. Such reasons would have
been enough to account for plain dress, quite apart from religious
feeling; but in Miss Brooke’s case, religion alone would have
determined it; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister’s
sentiments, only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to
accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation. Dorothea
knew many passages of Pascal’s Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart;
and to her the destinies of mankind, seen by the light of Christianity,
made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for
Bedlam. She could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life
involving eternal consequences, with a keen interest in gimp and
artificial protrusions of drapery. Her mind was theoretic, and yearned
by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might
frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there;
she was enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing
whatever seemed to her to have those aspects; likely to seek martyrdom,
to make retractations, and then to incur martyrdom after all in a
quarter where she had not sought it. Certainly such elements in the
character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot, and
hinder it from being decided according to custom, by good looks,
vanity, and merely canine affection. With all this, she, the elder of
the sisters, was not yet twenty, and they had both been educated, since
they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents, on plans
at once narrow and promiscuous, first in an English family and
afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne, their bachelor uncle and
guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their
orphaned condition.
It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with
their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous
opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,
and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too
rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brooke’s conclusions were as difficult to
predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with
benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as
possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite
minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax
about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,
concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.
In Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in
abeyance; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and
virtues, turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle’s talk or his
way of “letting things be” on his estate, and making her long all the
more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of
money for generous schemes. She was regarded as an heiress; for not
only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents, but
if Dorothea married and had a son, that son would inherit Mr. Brooke’s
estate, presumably worth about three thousand a-year—a rental which
seemed wealth to provincial families, still discussing Mr. Peel’s late
conduct on the Catholic question, innocent of future gold-fields, and
of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities
of genteel life.
And how should Dorothea not marry?—a girl so handsome and with such
prospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her
insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a
wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead
her at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and
fortune, who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick
laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the
time of the Apostles—who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist,
and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife
might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the
application of her income which would interfere with political economy
and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice
before he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to
have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic
life was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their
neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know
and avoid them.
The rural opinion about the new young ladies, even among the cottagers,
was generally in favor of Celia, as being so amiable and
innocent-looking, while Miss Brooke’s large eyes seemed, like her
religion, too unusual and striking. Poor Dorothea! compared with her,
the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise; so much
subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of
blazonry or clock-face for it.
Yet those who approached Dorothea, though prejudiced against her by
this alarming hearsay, found that she had a charm unaccountably
reconcilable with it. Most men thought her bewitching when she was on
horseback. She loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the
country, and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she
looked very little like a devotee. Riding was an indulgence which she
allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms; she felt that she
enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way, and always looked forward to
renouncing it.
She was open, ardent, and not in the least self-admiring; indeed, it
was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with
attractions altogether superior to her own, and if any gentleman
appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of
seeing Mr. Brooke, she concluded that he must be in love with Celia:
Sir James Chettam, for example, whom she constantly considered from
Celia’s point of view, inwardly debating whether it would be good for
Celia to accept him. That he should be regarded as a suitor to herself
would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance. Dorothea, with all
her eagerness to know the truths of life, retained very childlike ideas
about marriage. She felt sure that she would have accepted the
judicious Hooker, if she had been born in time to save him from that
wretched mistake he made in matrimony; or John Milton when his
blindness had come on; or any of the other great men whose odd habits
it would have been glorious piety to endure; but an amiable handsome
baronet, who said “Exactly” to her remarks even when she expressed
uncertainty,—how could he affect her as a lover? The really delightful
marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father, and
could teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it.
These peculiarities of Dorothea’s character caused Mr. Brooke to be all
the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some
middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces. But he himself
dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for
such a position, that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea’s
objections, and was in this case brave enough to defy the world—that is
to say, Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector’s wife, and the small group of
gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire. So
Miss Brooke presided in her uncle’s household, and did not at all
dislike her new authority, with the homage that belonged to it.
Sir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another
gentleman whom the girls had never seen, and about whom Dorothea felt
some venerating expectation. This was the Reverend Edward Casaubon,
noted in the county as a man of profound learning, understood for many
years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history; also
as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety, and having views
of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication
of his book. His very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be
measured without a precise chronology of scholarship.
Early in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she
had set going in the village, and was taking her usual place in the
pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters, bent on
finishing a plan for some buildings (a kind of work which she delighted
in), when Celia, who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to
propose something, said—
“Dorothea, dear, if you don’t mind—if you are not very busy—suppose we
looked at mamma’s jewels to-day, and divided them? It is exactly six
months to-day since uncle gave them to you, and you have not looked at
them yet.”
Celia’s face had the shadow of a pouting expression in it, the full
presence of the pout being kept back by an habitual awe of Dorothea and
principle; two associated facts which might show a mysterious
electricity if you touched them incautiously. To her relief, Dorothea’s
eyes were full of laughter as she looked up.
“What a wonderful little almanac you are, Celia! Is it six calendar or
six lunar months?”
“It is the last day of September now, and it was the first of April
when uncle gave them to you. You know, he said that he had forgotten
them till then. I believe you have never thought of them since you
locked them up in the cabinet here.”
“Well, dear, we should never wear them, you know.” Dorothea spoke in a
full cordial tone, half caressing, half explanatory. She had her pencil
in her hand, and was making tiny side-plans on a margin.
Celia colored, and looked very grave. “I think, dear, we are wanting in
respect to mamma’s memory, to put them by and take no notice of them.
And,” she added, after hesitating a little, with a rising sob of
mortification, “necklaces are quite usual now; and Madame Poincon, who
was stricter in some things even than you are, used to wear ornaments.
And Christians generally—surely there are women in heaven now who wore
jewels.” Celia was conscious of some mental strength when she really
applied herself to argument.
“You would like to wear them?” exclaimed Dorothea, an air of astonished
discovery animating her whole person with a dramatic action which she
had caught from that very Madame Poincon who wore the ornaments. “Of
course, then, let us have them out. Why did you not tell me before? But
the keys, the keys!” She pressed her hands against the sides of her
head and seemed to despair of her memory.
“They are here,” said Celia, with whom this explanation had been long
meditated and prearranged.
“Pray open the large drawer of the cabinet and get out the jewel-box.”
The casket was soon open before them, and the various jewels spread
out, making a bright parterre on the table. It was no great collection,
but a few of the ornaments were really of remarkable beauty, the finest
that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in
exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.
Dorothea immediately took up the necklace and fastened it round her
sister’s neck, where it fitted almost as closely as a bracelet; but the
circle suited the Henrietta-Maria style of Celia’s head and neck, and
she could see that it did, in the pier-glass opposite.
“There, Celia! you can wear that with your Indian muslin. But this
cross you must wear with your dark dresses.”
Celia was trying not to smile with pleasure. “O Dodo, you must keep the
cross yourself.”
“No, no, dear, no,” said Dorothea, putting up her hand with careless
deprecation.
“Yes, indeed you must; it would suit you—in your black dress, now,”
said Celia, insistingly. “You _might_ wear that.”
“Not for the world, not for the world. A cross is the last thing I
would wear as a trinket.” Dorothea shuddered slightly.
“Then you will think it wicked in me to wear it,” said Celia, uneasily.
“No, dear, no,” said Dorothea, stroking her sister’s cheek. “Souls have
complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.”
“But you might like to keep it for mamma’s sake.”
“No, I have other things of mamma’s—her sandal-wood box which I am so
fond of—plenty of things. In fact, they are all yours, dear. We need
discuss them no longer. There—take away your property.”
Celia felt a little hurt. There was a strong assumption of superiority
in this Puritanic toleration, hardly less trying to the blond flesh of
an unenthusiastic sister than a Puritanic persecution.
“But how can I wear ornaments if you, who are the elder sister, will
never wear them?”
“Nay, Celia, that is too much to ask, that I should wear trinkets to
keep you in countenance. If I were to put on such a necklace as that, I
should feel as if I had been pirouetting. The world would go round with
me, and I should not know how to walk.”
Celia had unclasped the necklace and drawn it off. “It would be a
little tight for your neck; something to lie down and hang would suit
you better,” she said, with some satisfaction. The complete unfitness
of the necklace from all points of view for Dorothea, made Celia
happier in taking it. She was opening some ring-boxes, which disclosed
a fine emerald with diamonds, and just then the sun passing beyond a
cloud sent a bright gleam over the table.
“How very beautiful these gems are!” said Dorothea, under a new current
of feeling, as sudden as the gleam. “It is strange how deeply colors
seem to penetrate one, like scent. I suppose that is the reason why
gems are used as spiritual emblems in the Revelation of St. John. They
look like fragments of heaven. I think that emerald is more beautiful
than any of them.”
“And there is a bracelet to match it,” said Celia. “We did not notice
this at first.”
“They are lovely,” said Dorothea, slipping the ring and bracelet on her
finely turned finger and wrist, and holding them towards the window on
a level with her eyes. All the while her thought was trying to justify
her delight in the colors by merging them in her mystic religious joy.
“You _would_ like those, Dorothea,” said Celia, rather falteringly,
beginning to think with wonder that her sister showed some weakness,
and also that emeralds would suit her own complexion even better than
purple amethysts. “You must keep that ring and bracelet—if nothing
else. But see, these agates are very pretty and quiet.”
“Yes! I will keep these—this ring and bracelet,” said Dorothea. Then,
letting her hand fall on the table, she said in another tone—“Yet what
miserable men find such things, and work at them, and sell them!” She
paused again, and Celia thought that her sister was going to renounce
the ornaments, as in consistency she ought to do.
“Yes, dear, I will keep these,” said Dorothea, decidedly. “But take all
the rest away, and the casket.”
She took up her pencil without removing the jewels, and still looking
at them. She thought of often having them by her, to feed her eye at
these little fountains of pure color.
“Shall you wear them in company?” said Celia, who was watching her with
real curiosity as to what she would do.
Dorothea glanced quickly at her sister. Across all her imaginative
adornment of those whom she loved, there darted now and then a keen
discernment, which was not without a scorching quality. If Miss Brooke
ever attained perfect meekness, it would not be for lack of inward
fire.
“Perhaps,” she said, rather haughtily. “I cannot tell to what level I
may sink.”
Celia blushed, and was unhappy: she saw that she had offended her
sister, and dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the
ornaments which she put back into the box and carried away. Dorothea
too was unhappy, as she went on with her plan-drawing, questioning the
purity of her own feeling and speech in the scene which had ended with
that little explosion.
Celia’s consciousness told her that she had not been at all in the
wrong: it was quite natural and justifiable that she should have asked
that question, and she repeated to herself that Dorothea was
inconsistent: either she should have taken her full share of the
jewels, or, after what she had said, she should have renounced them
altogether.
“I am sure—at least, I trust,” thought Celia, “that the wearing of a
necklace will not interfere with my prayers. And I do not see that I
should be bound by Dorothea’s opinions now we are going into society,
though of course she herself ought to be bound by them. But Dorothea is
not always consistent.”
Thus Celia, mutely bending over her tapestry, until she heard her
sister calling her.
“Here, Kitty, come and look at my plan; I shall think I am a great
architect, if I have not got incompatible stairs and fireplaces.”
As Celia bent over the paper, Dorothea put her cheek against her
sister’s arm caressingly. Celia understood the action. Dorothea saw
that she had been in the wrong, and Celia pardoned her. Since they
could remember, there had been a mixture of criticism and awe in the
attitude of Celia’s mind towards her elder sister. The younger had
always worn a yoke; but is there any yoked creature without its private
opinions?
CHAPTER II.
“‘Dime; no ves aquel caballero que hacia nosotros viene sobre un
caballo rucio rodado que trae puesto en la cabeza un yelmo de oro?’ ‘Lo
que veo y columbro,’ respondio Sancho, ‘no es sino un hombre sobre un
as no pardo como el mio, que trae sobre la cabeza una cosa que
relumbra.’ ‘Pues ese es el yelmo de Mambrino,’ dijo Don
Quijote.”—CERVANTES.
“‘Seest thou not yon cavalier who cometh toward us on a dapple-gray
steed, and weareth a golden helmet?’ ‘What I see,’ answered Sancho, ‘is
nothing but a man on a gray ass like my own, who carries something
shiny on his head.’ ‘Just so,’ answered Don Quixote: ‘and that
resplendent object is the helmet of Mambrino.’”
“Sir Humphry Davy?” said Mr. Brooke, over the soup, in his easy smiling
way, taking up Sir James Chettam’s remark that he was studying Davy’s
Agricultural Chemistry. “Well, now, Sir Humphry Davy; I dined with him
years ago at Cartwright’s, and Wordsworth was there too—the poet
Wordsworth, you know. Now there was something singular. I was at
Cambridge when Wordsworth was there, and I never met him—and I dined
with him twenty years afterwards at Cartwright’s. There’s an oddity in
things, now. But Davy was there: he was a poet too. Or, as I may say,
Wordsworth was poet one, and Davy was poet two. That was true in every
sense, you know.”
Dorothea felt a little more uneasy than usual. In the beginning of
dinner, the party being small and the room still, these motes from the
mass of a magistrate’s mind fell too noticeably. She wondered how a man
like Mr. Casaubon would support such triviality. His manners, she
thought, were very dignified; the set of his iron-gray hair and his
deep eye-sockets made him resemble the portrait of Locke. He had the
spare form and the pale complexion which became a student; as different
as possible from the blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type
represented by Sir James Chettam.
“I am reading the Agricultural Chemistry,” said this excellent baronet,
“because I am going to take one of the farms into my own hands, and see
if something cannot be done in setting a good pattern of farming among
my tenants. Do you approve of that, Miss Brooke?”
“A great mistake, Chettam,” interposed Mr. Brooke, “going into
electrifying your land and that kind of thing, and making a parlor of
your cow-house. It won’t do. I went into science a great deal myself at
one time; but I saw it would not do. It leads to everything; you can
let nothing alone. No, no—see that your tenants don’t sell their straw,
and that kind of thing; and give them draining-tiles, you know. But
your fancy farming will not do—the most expensive sort of whistle you
can buy: you may as well keep a pack of hounds.”
“Surely,” said Dorothea, “it is better to spend money in finding out
how men can make the most of the land which supports them all, than in
keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it. It is not a sin to make
yourself poor in performing experiments for the good of all.”
She spoke with more energy than is expected of so young a lady, but Sir
James had appealed to her. He was accustomed to do so, and she had
often thought that she could urge him to many good actions when he was
her brother-in-law.
Mr. Casaubon turned his eyes very markedly on Dorothea while she was
speaking, and seemed to observe her newly.
“Young ladies don’t understand political economy, you know,” said Mr.
Brooke, smiling towards Mr. Casaubon. “I remember when we were all
reading Adam Smith. _There_ is a book, now. I took in all the new ideas
at one time—human perfectibility, now. But some say, history moves in
circles; and that may be very well argued; I have argued it myself. The
fact is, human reason may carry you a little too far—over the hedge, in
fact. It carried me a good way at one time; but I saw it would not do.
I pulled up; I pulled up in time. But not too hard. I have always been
in favor of a little theory: we must have Thought; else we shall be
landed back in the dark ages. But talking of books, there is Southey’s
‘Peninsular War.’ I am reading that of a morning. You know Southey?”
“No,” said Mr. Casaubon, not keeping pace with Mr. Brooke’s impetuous
reason, and thinking of the book only. “I have little leisure for such
literature just now. I have been using up my eyesight on old characters
lately; the fact is, I want a reader for my evenings; but I am
fastidious in voices, and I cannot endure listening to an imperfect
reader. It is a misfortune, in some senses: I feed too much on the
inward sources; I live too much with the dead. My mind is something
like the ghost of an ancient, wandering about the world and trying
mentally to construct it as it used to be, in spite of ruin and
confusing changes. But I find it necessary to use the utmost caution
about my eyesight.”
This was the first time that Mr. Casaubon had spoken at any length. He
delivered himself with precision, as if he had been called upon to make
a public statement; and the balanced sing-song neatness of his speech,
occasionally corresponded to by a movement of his head, was the more
conspicuous from its contrast with good Mr. Brooke’s scrappy
slovenliness. Dorothea said to herself that Mr. Casaubon was the most
interesting man she had ever seen, not excepting even Monsieur Liret,
the Vaudois clergyman who had given conferences on the history of the
Waldenses. To reconstruct a past world, doubtless with a view to the
highest purposes of truth—what a work to be in any way present at, to
assist in, though only as a lamp-holder! This elevating thought lifted
her above her annoyance at being twitted with her ignorance of
political economy, that never-explained science which was thrust as an
extinguisher over all her lights.
“But you are fond of riding, Miss Brooke,” Sir James presently took an
opportunity of saying. “I should have thought you would enter a little
into the pleasures of hunting. I wish you would let me send over a
chestnut horse for you to try. It has been trained for a lady. I saw
you on Saturday cantering over the hill on a nag not worthy of you. My
groom shall bring Corydon for you every day, if you will only mention
the time.”
“Thank you, you are very good. I mean to give up riding. I shall not
ride any more,” said Dorothea, urged to this brusque resolution by a
little annoyance that Sir James would be soliciting her attention when
she wanted to give it all to Mr. Casaubon.
“No, that is too hard,” said Sir James, in a tone of reproach that
showed strong interest. “Your sister is given to self-mortification, is
she not?” he continued, turning to Celia, who sat at his right hand.
“I think she is,” said Celia, feeling afraid lest she should say
something that would not please her sister, and blushing as prettily as
possible above her necklace. “She likes giving up.”
“If that were true, Celia, my giving-up would be self-indulgence, not
self-mortification. But there may be good reasons for choosing not to
do what is very agreeable,” said Dorothea.
Mr. Brooke was speaking at the same time, but it was evident that Mr.
Casaubon was observing Dorothea, and she was aware of it.
“Exactly,” said Sir James. “You give up from some high, generous
motive.”
“No, indeed, not exactly. I did not say that of myself,” answered
Dorothea, reddening. Unlike Celia, she rarely blushed, and only from
high delight or anger. At this moment she felt angry with the perverse
Sir James. Why did he not pay attention to Celia, and leave her to
listen to Mr. Casaubon?—if that learned man would only talk, instead of
allowing himself to be talked to by Mr. Brooke, who was just then
informing him that the Reformation either meant something or it did
not, that he himself was a Protestant to the core, but that Catholicism
was a fact; and as to refusing an acre of your ground for a Romanist
chapel, all men needed the bridle of religion, which, properly
speaking, was the dread of a Hereafter.
“I made a great study of theology at one time,” said Mr. Brooke, as if
to explain the insight just manifested. “I know something of all
schools. I knew Wilberforce in his best days. Do you know Wilberforce?”
Mr. Casaubon said, “No.”
“Well, Wilberforce was perhaps not enough of a thinker; but if I went
into Parliament, as I have been asked to do, I should sit on the
independent bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy.”
Mr. Casaubon bowed, and observed that it was a wide field.
“Yes,” said Mr. Brooke, with an easy smile, “but I have documents. I
began a long while ago to collect documents. They want arranging, but
when a question has struck me, I have written to somebody and got an
answer. I have documents at my back. But now, how do you arrange your
documents?”
“In pigeon-holes partly,” said Mr. Casaubon, with rather a startled air
of effort.
“Ah, pigeon-holes will not do. I have tried pigeon-holes, but
everything gets mixed in pigeon-holes: I never know whether a paper is
in A or Z.”
“I wish you would let me sort your papers for you, uncle,” said
Dorothea. “I would letter them all, and then make a list of subjects
under each letter.”
Mr. Casaubon gravely smiled approval, and said to Mr. Brooke, “You have
an excellent secretary at hand, you perceive.”
“No, no,” said Mr. Brooke, shaking his head; “I cannot let young ladies
meddle with my documents. Young ladies are too flighty.”
Dorothea felt hurt. Mr. Casaubon would think that her uncle had some
special reason for delivering this opinion, whereas the remark lay in
his mind as lightly as the broken wing of an insect among all the other
fragments there, and a chance current had sent it alighting on _her_.
When the two girls were in the drawing-room alone, Celia said—
“How very ugly Mr. Casaubon is!”
“Celia! He is one of the most distinguished-looking men I ever saw. He
is remarkably like the portrait of Locke. He has the same deep
eye-sockets.”
“Had Locke those two white moles with hairs on them?”
“Oh, I dare say! when people of a certain sort looked at him,” said
Dorothea, walking away a little.
“Mr. Casaubon is so sallow.”
“All the better. I suppose you admire a man with the complexion of a
_cochon de lait_.”
“Dodo!” exclaimed Celia, looking after her in surprise. “I never heard
you make such a comparison before.”
“Why should I make it before the occasion came? It is a good
comparison: the match is perfect.”
Miss Brooke was clearly forgetting herself, and Celia thought so.
“I wonder you show temper, Dorothea.”
“It is so painful in you, Celia, that you will look at human beings as
if they were merely animals with a toilet, and never see the great soul
in a man’s face.”
“Has Mr. Casaubon a great soul?” Celia was not without a touch of naive
malice.
“Yes, I believe he has,” said Dorothea, with the full voice of
decision. “Everything I see in him corresponds to his pamphlet on
Biblical Cosmology.”
“He talks very little,” said Celia
“There is no one for him to talk to.”
Celia thought privately, “Dorothea quite despises Sir James Chettam; I
believe she would not accept him.” Celia felt that this was a pity. She
had never been deceived as to the object of the baronet’s interest.
Sometimes, indeed, she had reflected that Dodo would perhaps not make a
husband happy who had not her way of looking at things; and stifled in
the depths of her heart was the feeling that her sister was too
religious for family comfort. Notions and scruples were like spilt
needles, making one afraid of treading, or sitting down, or even
eating.
When Miss Brooke was at the tea-table, Sir James came to sit down by
her, not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive. Why
should he? He thought it probable that Miss Brooke liked him, and
manners must be very marked indeed before they cease to be interpreted
by preconceptions either confident or distrustful. She was thoroughly
charming to him, but of course he theorized a little about his
attachment. He was made of excellent human dough, and had the rare
merit of knowing that his talents, even if let loose, would not set the
smallest stream in the county on fire: hence he liked the prospect of a
wife to whom he could say, “What shall we do?” about this or that; who
could help her husband out with reasons, and would also have the
property qualification for doing so. As to the excessive religiousness
alleged against Miss Brooke, he had a very indefinite notion of what it
consisted in, and thought that it would die out with marriage. In
short, he felt himself to be in love in the right place, and was ready
to endure a great deal of predominance, which, after all, a man could
always put down when he liked. Sir James had no idea that he should
ever like to put down the predominance of this handsome girl, in whose
cleverness he delighted. Why not? A man’s mind—what there is of it—has
always the advantage of being masculine,—as the smallest birch-tree is
of a higher kind than the most soaring palm,—and even his ignorance is
of a sounder quality. Sir James might not have originated this
estimate; but a kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with
a little gum or starch in the form of tradition.
“Let me hope that you will rescind that resolution about the horse,
Miss Brooke,” said the persevering admirer. “I assure you, riding is
the most healthy of exercises.”
“I am aware of it,” said Dorothea, coldly. “I think it would do Celia
good—if she would take to it.”
“But you are such a perfect horsewoman.”
“Excuse me; I have had very little practice, and I should be easily
thrown.”
“Then that is a reason for more practice. Every lady ought to be a
perfect horsewoman, that she may accompany her husband.”
“You see how widely we differ, Sir James. I have made up my mind that I
ought not to be a perfect horsewoman, and so I should never correspond
to your pattern of a lady.” Dorothea looked straight before her, and
spoke with cold brusquerie, very much with the air of a handsome boy,
in amusing contrast with the solicitous amiability of her admirer.
“I should like to know your reasons for this cruel resolution. It is
not possible that you should think horsemanship wrong.”
“It is quite possible that I should think it wrong for me.”
“Oh, why?” said Sir James, in a tender tone of remonstrance.
Mr. Casaubon had come up to the table, teacup in hand, and was
listening.
“We must not inquire too curiously into motives,” he interposed, in his
measured way. “Miss Brooke knows that they are apt to become feeble in
the utterance: the aroma is mixed with the grosser air. We must keep
the germinating grain away from the light.”
Dorothea colored with pleasure, and looked up gratefully to the
speaker. Here was a man who could understand the higher inward life,
and with whom there could be some spiritual communion; nay, who could
illuminate principle with the widest knowledge: a man whose learning
almost amounted to a proof of whatever he believed!
Dorothea’s inferences may seem large; but really life could never have
gone on at any period but for this liberal allowance of conclusions,
which has facilitated marriage under the difficulties of civilization.
Has any one ever pinched into its pilulous smallness the cobweb of
pre-matrimonial acquaintanceship?
“Certainly,” said good Sir James. “Miss Brooke shall not be urged to
tell reasons she would rather be silent upon. I am sure her reasons
would do her honor.”
He was not in the least jealous of the interest with which Dorothea had
looked up at Mr. Casaubon: it never occurred to him that a girl to whom
he was meditating an offer of marriage could care for a dried bookworm
towards fifty, except, indeed, in a religious sort of way, as for a
clergyman of some distinction.
However, since Miss Brooke had become engaged in a conversation with
Mr. Casaubon about the Vaudois clergy, Sir James betook himself to
Celia, and talked to her about her sister; spoke of a house in town,
and asked whether Miss Brooke disliked London. Away from her sister,
Celia talked quite easily, and Sir James said to himself that the
second Miss Brooke was certainly very agreeable as well as pretty,
though not, as some people pretended, more clever and sensible than the
elder sister. He felt that he had chosen the one who was in all
respects the superior; and a man naturally likes to look forward to
having the best. He would be the very Mawworm of bachelors who
pretended not to expect it.
CHAPTER III.
“Say, goddess, what ensued, when Raphael,
The affable archangel . . .
Eve
The story heard attentive, and was filled
With admiration, and deep muse, to hear
Of things so high and strange.”
—_Paradise Lost_, B. vii.
If it had really occurred to Mr. Casaubon to think of Miss Brooke as a
suitable wife for him, the reasons that might induce her to accept him
were already planted in her mind, and by the evening of the next day
the reasons had budded and bloomed. For they had had a long
conversation in the morning, while Celia, who did not like the company
of Mr. Casaubon’s moles and sallowness, had escaped to the vicarage to
play with the curate’s ill-shod but merry children.
Dorothea by this time had looked deep into the ungauged reservoir of
Mr. Casaubon’s mind, seeing reflected there in vague labyrinthine
extension every quality she herself brought; had opened much of her own
experience to him, and had understood from him the scope of his great
work, also of attractively labyrinthine extent. For he had been as
instructive as Milton’s “affable archangel;” and with something of the
archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show (what
indeed had been attempted before, but not with that thoroughness,
justice of comparison, and effectiveness of arrangement at which Mr.
Casaubon aimed) that all the mythical systems or erratic mythical
fragments in the world were corruptions of a tradition originally
revealed. Having once mastered the true position and taken a firm
footing there, the vast field of mythical constructions became
intelligible, nay, luminous with the reflected light of
correspondences. But to gather in this great harvest of truth was no
light or speedy work. His notes already made a formidable range of
volumes, but the crowning task would be to condense these voluminous
still-accumulating results and bring them, like the earlier vintage of
Hippocratic books, to fit a little shelf. In explaining this to
Dorothea, Mr. Casaubon expressed himself nearly as he would have done
to a fellow-student, for he had not two styles of talking at command:
it is true that when he used a Greek or Latin phrase he always gave the
English with scrupulous care, but he would probably have done this in
any case. A learned provincial clergyman is accustomed to think of his
acquaintances as of “lords, knyghtes, and other noble and worthi men,
that conne Latyn but lytille.”
Dorothea was altogether captivated by the wide embrace of this
conception. Here was something beyond the shallows of ladies’ school
literature: here was a living Bossuet, whose work would reconcile
complete knowledge with devoted piety; here was a modern Augustine who
united the glories of doctor and saint.
The sanctity seemed no less clearly marked than the learning, for when
Dorothea was impelled to open her mind on certain themes which she
could speak of to no one whom she had before seen at Tipton, especially
on the secondary importance of ecclesiastical forms and articles of
belief compared with that spiritual religion, that submergence of self
in communion with Divine perfection which seemed to her to be expressed
in the best Christian books of widely distant ages, she found in Mr.
Casaubon a listener who understood her at once, who could assure her of
his own agreement with that view when duly tempered with wise
conformity, and could mention historical examples before unknown to
her.
“He thinks with me,” said Dorothea to herself, “or rather, he thinks a
whole world of which my thought is but a poor twopenny mirror. And his
feelings too, his whole experience—what a lake compared with my little
pool!”
Miss Brooke argued from words and dispositions not less unhesitatingly
than other young ladies of her age. Signs are small measurable things,
but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent
nature, every sign is apt to conjure up wonder, hope, belief, vast as a
sky, and colored by a diffused thimbleful of matter in the shape of
knowledge. They are not always too grossly deceived; for Sinbad himself
may have fallen by good-luck on a true description, and wrong reasoning
sometimes lands poor mortals in right conclusions: starting a long way
off the true point, and proceeding by loops and zigzags, we now and
then arrive just where we ought to be. Because Miss Brooke was hasty in
her trust, it is not therefore clear that Mr. Casaubon was unworthy of
it.
He stayed a little longer than he had intended, on a slight pressure of
invitation from Mr. Brooke, who offered no bait except his own
documents on machine-breaking and rick-burning. Mr. Casaubon was called
into the library to look at these in a heap, while his host picked up
first one and then the other to read aloud from in a skipping and
uncertain way, passing from one unfinished passage to another with a
“Yes, now, but here!” and finally pushing them all aside to open the
journal of his youthful Continental travels.
“Look here—here is all about Greece. Rhamnus, the ruins of Rhamnus—you
are a great Grecian, now. I don’t know whether you have given much
study to the topography. I spent no end of time in making out these
things—Helicon, now. Here, now!—‘We started the next morning for
Parnassus, the double-peaked Parnassus.’ All this volume is about
Greece, you know,” Mr. Brooke wound up, rubbing his thumb transversely
along the edges of the leaves as he held the book forward.
Mr. Casaubon made a dignified though somewhat sad audience; bowed in
the right place, and avoided looking at anything documentary as far as
possible, without showing disregard or impatience; mindful that this
desultoriness was associated with the institutions of the country, and
that the man who took him on this severe mental scamper was not only an
amiable host, but a landholder and custos rotulorum. Was his endurance
aided also by the reflection that Mr. Brooke was the uncle of Dorothea?
Certainly he seemed more and more bent on making her talk to him, on
drawing her out, as Celia remarked to herself; and in looking at her
his face was often lit up by a smile like pale wintry sunshine. Before
he left the next morning, while taking a pleasant walk with Miss Brooke
along the gravelled terrace, he had mentioned to her that he felt the
disadvantage of loneliness, the need of that cheerful companionship
with which the presence of youth can lighten or vary the serious toils
of maturity. And he delivered this statement with as much careful
precision as if he had been a diplomatic envoy whose words would be
attended with results. Indeed, Mr. Casaubon was not used to expect that
he should have to repeat or revise his communications of a practical or
personal kind. The inclinations which he had deliberately stated on the
2d of October he would think it enough to refer to by the mention of
that date; judging by the standard of his own memory, which was a
volume where a vide supra could serve instead of repetitions, and not
the ordinary long-used blotting-book which only tells of forgotten
writing. But in this case Mr. Casaubon’s confidence was not likely to
be falsified, for Dorothea heard and retained what he said with the
eager interest of a fresh young nature to which every variety in
experience is an epoch.

PREFATORY NOTE
François le Champi, a pretty idyl that tells of homely affections,
self-devotion, "humble cares and delicate fears," opens a little vista
into that Arcadia to which, the poet says, we were all born. It offers
many difficulties to the translator. It is a rustic tale, put into the
mouths of peasants, who relate it with a primitive simplicity, sweet and
full of sentiment in the French, but prone to degenerate into
mawkishness and monotony when turned into English. Great care has been
taken to keep the English of this version simple and idiomatic, and yet
religiously to avoid any breach of faith toward the author. It is hoped
that, though the original pure and limpid waters have necessarily
contracted some stain by being forced into another channel, they may yet
yield refreshment to those thirsty souls who cannot seek them at the
fountain-head.

PREFACE
FRANÇOIS LE CHAMPI appeared for the first time in the _feuilleton_ of
the "Journal des Débats." Just as the plot of my story was reaching its
development, another more serious development was announced in the first
column of the same newspaper. It was the final downfall of the July
Monarchy, in the last days of February, 1848.
This catastrophe was naturally very prejudicial to my story, the
publication of which was interrupted and delayed, and not finally
completed, if I remember correctly, until the end of a month. For those
of my readers who are artists either by profession or instinct, and are
interested in the details of the construction of works of art, I shall
add to my introduction that, some days before the conversation of which
that introduction is the outcome, I took a walk through the _Chemin aux
Napes_. The word _nape_, which, in the figurative language of that part
of the country, designates the beautiful plant called _nénufar_, or
_nymphææ_, is happily descriptive of the broad leaves that lie upon the
surface of the water, as a cloth (_nappe_) upon a table; but I prefer to
write it with a single _p_, and to trace its derivation from _napée_,
thus leaving unchanged its mythological origin.
The _Chemin aux Napes_, which probably none of you, my dear readers,
will ever see, as it leads to nothing that can repay you for the trouble
of passing through so much mire, is a break-neck path, skirting along a
ditch where, in the muddy water, grow the most beautiful nymphææ in
the world, more fragrant than lilies, whiter than camellias, purer than
the vesture of virgins, in the midst of the lizards and other reptiles
that crawl about the mud and flowers, while the kingfisher darts like
living lightning along the banks, and skims with a fiery track the rank
and luxuriant vegetation of the sewer.
A child six or seven years old, mounted bare-back upon a loose horse,
made the animal leap the hedge behind me, and then, letting himself
slide to the ground, left his shaggy colt in the pasture, and returned
to try jumping over the barrier which he had so lightly crossed on
horseback a minute before. It was not such an easy task for his little
legs; I helped him, and had with him a conversation similar to that
between the miller's wife and the foundling, related in the beginning of
"The Waif." When I questioned him about his age, which he did not know,
he literally delivered himself of the brilliant reply that he was two
years old. He knew neither his own name, nor that of his parents, nor of
the place he lived in; all that he knew was to cling on an unbroken
colt, as a bird clings to a branch shaken by the storm.
I have had educated several foundlings of both sexes, who have turned
out well physically and morally. It is no less certain, however, that
these forlorn children are apt, in rural districts, to become bandits,
owing to their utter lack of education. Intrusted to the care of the
poorest people, because of the insufficient pittance assigned to them,
they often practise, for the benefit of their adopted parents, the
shameful calling of beggars. Would it not be possible to increase this
pittance on condition that the foundlings shall never beg, even at the
doors of their neighbors and friends?
I have also learned by experience that nothing is more difficult than to
teach self-respect and the love of work to children who have already
begun understandingly to live upon alms.

THE WAIF
INTRODUCTION
R*** AND I were coming home from our walk by the light of the moon
which faintly silvered the dusky country lanes. It was a mild autumn
evening, and the sky was slightly overcast; we observed the resonance of
the air peculiar to the season, and a certain mystery spread over the
face of nature. At the approach of the long winter sleep, it seems as if
every creature and thing stealthily agreed to enjoy what is left of life
and animation before the deadly torpor of the frost; and as if the whole
creation, in order to cheat the march of time, and to avoid being
detected and interrupted in the last frolics of its festival, advanced
without sound or apparent motion toward its orgies in the night. The
birds give out stifled cries instead of their joyous summer warblings.
The cricket of the fields sometimes chirps inadvertently; but it soon
stops again, and carries elsewhere its song or its wail. The plants
hastily breathe out their last perfume, which is all the sweeter for
being more delicate and less profuse. The yellowing leaves now no longer
rustle in the breeze, and the flocks and herds graze in silence without
cries of love or combat.
My friend and I walked quietly along, and our involuntary thoughtfulness
made us silent and attentive to the softened beauty of nature, and to
the enchanting harmony of her last chords, which were dying away in an
imperceptible _pianissimo_. Autumn is a sad and sweet _andante_, which
makes an admirable preparation for the solemn _adagio_ of winter.
"It is all so peaceful," said my friend at last, for, in spite of our
silence, he had followed my thoughts as I followed his; "everything
seems absorbed in a reverie so foreign and so indifferent to the labors,
cares, and preoccupations of man, that I wonder what expression, what
color, and what form of art and poetry human intelligence could give at
this moment to the face of nature. In order to explain better to you the
end of my inquiry, I may compare the evening, the sky, and the
landscape, dimmed, and yet harmonious and complete, to the soul of a
wise and religious peasant, who labors and profits by his toil, who
rejoices in the possession of the life to which he is born, without the
need, the longing, or the means of revealing and expressing his inner
life. I try to place myself in the heart of the mystery of this natural
rustic life--I, who am civilized, who cannot enjoy by instinct alone,
and who am always tormented by the desire of giving an account of my
contemplation, or of my meditation, to myself and to others.
"Then, too," continued my friend, "I am trying to find out what relation
can be established between my intelligence, which is too active, and
that of the peasant, which is not active enough; just as I was
considering a moment ago what painting, music, description, the
interpretation of art, in short, could add to the beauty of the autumnal
night which is revealed to me in its mysterious silence, and affects me
in some magical and unknown way."
"Let us see," said I, "how your question is put. This October night,
this colorless sky, this music without any distinct or connected melody,
this calm of nature, and the peasant who by his very simplicity is more
able than we to enjoy and understand it, though he cannot portray
it--let us put all this together and call it _primitive life_, with
relation to our own highly developed and complicated life, which I shall
call _artificial life_. You are asking what possible connection or
direct link can there be between these two opposite conditions in the
existence of persons and things; between the palace and the cottage,
between the artist and the universe, between the poet and the laborer."
"Yes," he answered, "and let us be exact: between the language spoken by
nature, primitive life, and instinct, and that spoken by art,
science,--in a word, by _knowledge_."
"To answer in the language you have adopted, I should say that the link
between _knowledge_ and sensation is _feeling_."
"It is about the definition of feeling that I am going to question you
and myself, for its mission is the interpretation which is troubling me.
It is the art or artist, if you prefer, empowered to translate the
purity, grace, and charm of the primitive life to those who only live
the artificial life, and who are, if you will allow me to say so, the
greatest fools in the world in the presence of nature and her divine
secrets."
"You are asking nothing less than the secret of art, and you must look
for it in the breast of God. No artist can reveal it, for he does not
know it himself, and cannot give an account of the sources of his own
inspiration or his own weakness. How shall one attempt to express
beauty, simplicity, and truth? Do I know? And can anybody teach us? No,
not even the greatest artists, because if they tried to do so they would
cease to be artists, and would become critics; and criticism--"
"And criticism," rejoined my friend, "has been revolving for centuries
about the mystery without understanding it. But, excuse me, that is not
exactly what I meant. I am still more radical at this moment, and call
the power of art in question. I despise it, I annihilate it, I declare
that art is not born, that it does not exist; or, if it has been, its
time is past. It is exhausted, it has no more expression, no more breath
of life, no more means to sing of the beauty of truth. Nature is a work
of art, but God is the only artist that exists, and man is but an
arranger in bad taste. Nature is beautiful, and breathes feeling from
all her pores; love, youth, beauty are in her imperishable. But man has
but foolish means and miserable faculties for feeling and expressing
them. He had better keep aloof, silent and absorbed in contemplation.
Come, what have you to say?"
"I agree, and am quite satisfied with your opinion," I answered.
"Ah!" he cried, "you are going too far, and embrace my paradox too
warmly. I am only pleading, and want you to reply."
"I reply, then, that a sonnet of Petrarch has its relative beauty, which
is equivalent to the beauty of the water of Vaucluse; that a fine
landscape of Ruysdael has a charm which equals that of this evening;
that Mozart sings in the language of men as well as Philomel in that of
birds; that Shakspeare delineates passions, emotions, and instincts as
vividly as the actual primitive man can experience them. This is art and
its relativeness--in short, feeling."
"Yes, it is all a work of transformation! But suppose that it does not
satisfy me? Even if you were a thousand times in the right according to
the decrees of taste and esthetics, what if I think Petrarch's verses
less harmonious than the roar of the waterfall, and so on? If I maintain
that there is in this evening a charm that no one could reveal to me
unless I had felt it myself; and that all Shakspeare's passion is cold in
comparison with that I see gleaming in the eyes of a jealous peasant who
beats his wife, what should you have to say? You must convince my
feeling. And if it eludes your examples and resists your proofs? Art is
not an invincible demonstrator, and feeling not always satisfied by the
best definition."
"I have really nothing to answer except that art is a demonstration of
which nature is the proof; that the preëxisting fact of the proof is
always present to justify or contradict the demonstration, which nobody
can make successfully unless he examine the proof with religious love."
"So the demonstration could not do without the proof; but could the
proof do without the demonstration?"
"No doubt God could do without it; but, although you are talking as if
you did not belong to us, I am willing to wager that you would
understand nothing of the proof if you had not found the demonstration
under a thousand forms in the tradition of art, and if you were not
yourself a demonstration constantly acting upon the proof."
"That is just what I am complaining of. I should like to rid myself of
this eternal irritating demonstration; to erase from my memory the
teachings and the forms of art; never to think of painting when I look
at a landscape, of music when I listen to the wind, or of poetry when I
admire and take delight in both together. I should like to enjoy
everything instinctively, because I think that the cricket which is
singing just now is more joyous and ecstatic than I."
"You complain, then, of being a man?"
"No; I complain of being no longer a primitive man."
"It remains to be known whether he was capable of enjoying what he could
not understand."
"I do not suppose that he was similar to the brutes, for as soon as he
became a man he thought and felt differently from them. But I cannot
form an exact idea of his emotions, and that is what bothers me. I
should like to be what the existing state of society allows a great
number of men to be from the cradle to the grave--I should like to be a
peasant; a peasant who does not know how to read, whom God has endowed
with good instincts, a serene organization, and an upright conscience;
and I fancy that in the sluggishness of my useless faculties, and in the
Ignorance of depraved tastes, I should be as happy as the primitive man
of Jean-Jacques's dreams."
"I, too, have had this same dream; who has not? But, even so, your
reasoning is not conclusive, for the most simple and ingenuous peasant
may still be an artist; and I believe even that his art is superior to
ours. The form is different, but it appeals more strongly to me than all
the forms which belong to civilization. Songs, ballads, and rustic tales
say in a few words what our literature can only amplify and disguise."
"I may triumph, then?" resumed my friend. "The peasant's art is the
best, because it is more directly inspired by nature by being in closer
contact with her. I confess I went to extremes in saying that art was
good for nothing; but I meant that I should like to feel after the
fashion of the peasant, and I do not contradict myself now. There are
certain Breton laments, made by beggars, which in three couplets are
worth all Goethe and Byron put together, and which prove that
appreciation of truth and beauty was more spontaneous and complete in
such simple souls than in our most distinguished poets. And music, too!
Is not our country full of lovely melodies? And though they do not
possess painting as an art, they have it in their speech, which is a
hundred times more expressive, forcible, and logical than our literary
language."
"I agree with you," said I, "especially as to this last point. It drives
me to despair that I am obliged to write in the language of the Academy,
when I am much more familiar with another tongue infinitely more fitted
for expressing a whole order of emotions, thoughts, and feelings."
"Oh, yes!" said he, "that fresh and unknown world is closed to modern
art, and no study can help you to express it even to yourself, with all
your sympathies for the peasant, if you try to introduce it into the
domain of civilized art and the intellectual intercourse of artificial
life."
"Alas!" I answered, "this thought has often disturbed me. I have myself
seen and felt, in common with all civilized beings, that primitive life
was the dream and ideal of all men and all times. From the shepherds of
Longus down to those of Trianon, pastoral life has been a perfumed Eden,
where souls wearied and harassed by the tumult of the world have sought
a refuge. Art, which has always flattered and fawned upon the too
fortunate among mankind, has passed through an unbroken series of
_pastorals_. And under the title of 'The History of Pastorals' I have
often wished to write a learned and critical work, in which to review
all the different rural dreams to which the upper classes have so fondly
clung.
"I should follow their modifications, which are always in inverse
relation to the depravity of morals, for they become innocent and
sentimental in proportion as society is shameless and corrupt. I should
like to _order_ this book of a writer better qualified than I to
accomplish it, and then I should read it with delight. It should be a
complete treatise on art; for music, painting, architecture, literature
in all its forms, the theater, poetry, romances, eclogues, songs,
fashions, gardens, and even dress, have been influenced by the
infatuation for the pastoral dream. All the types of the golden age, the
shepherdesses of Astræa, who are first nymphs and then marchionesses,
and who pass through the Lignon of Florian, wear satin and powder under
Louis XV., and are put into sabots by Sedaine at the end of the
monarchy, ate all more or less false, and seem to us to-day contemptible
and ridiculous. We have done with them, and see only their ghosts at the
opera; and yet they once reigned at court and were the delight of kings,
who borrowed from them the shepherd's crook and scrip.
"I have often wondered why there are no more shepherds, for we are not
so much in love with the truth lately that art and literature can afford
to despise the old conventional types rather than those introduced by
the present mode. To-day we are devoted to force and brutality, and on
the background of these passions we embroider decorations horrible
enough to make our hair stand on end if we could take them seriously."
"If we have no more shepherds," rejoined my friend, "and if literature
has changed one false ideal for another, is it not an involuntary
attempt of art to bring itself down to the level of the intelligence of
all classes? Does not the dream of equality afloat in society impel art
to a fierce brutality in order to awaken those instincts and passions
common to all men, of whatever rank they may be? Nobody has as yet
reached the truth. It exists no more in a hideous realism than in an
embellished idealism; but there is plainly a search for it, and if the
search is in the wrong direction, the eagerness of the pursuit is only
quickened. Let us see: the drama, poetry, and the novel have thrown away
the shepherd's crook for the dagger, and when rustic life appears on the
scene it has a stamp of reality which was wanting in the old pastorals.
But there is no more poetry in it, I am sorry to say; and I do not yet
see the means of reinstating the pastoral ideal without making it either
too gaudy or too somber. You have often thought of doing it, I know; but
can you hope for success?"
"No," I answered, "for there is no form for me to adopt, and there is no
language in which to express my conception of rustic simplicity. If I
made the laborer of the fields speak as he does speak, it would be
necessary to have a translation on the opposite page for the civilized
reader; and if I made him speak as we do, I should create an impossible
being, in whom it would be necessary to suppose an order of ideas which
he does not possess."
"Even if you made him speak as he does speak, your own language would
constantly make a disagreeable contrast; and in my opinion you cannot
escape this criticism. You describe a peasant girl, call her _Jeanne_,
and put into her mouth words which she might possibly use. But you, who
are the writer of the novel, and are anxious to make your readers
understand your fondness for painting this kind of type--you compare her
to a druidess, to a Jeanne d'Arc, and so on. Your opinions and language
make an incongruous effect with hers, like the clashing of harsh colors
in a picture; and this is not the way fully to enter into nature, even
if you idealize her. Since then you have made a better and more truthful
study in 'The Devil's Pool.' Still, I am not yet satisfied; the tip of
the author's finger is apparent from time to time; and there are some
author's words, as they are called by Henri Mounier, an artist who has
succeeded in being true in _caricature_, and who has consequently solved
the problem he had set for himself. I know that your own problem is no
easier to solve. But you must still try, although you are sure of not
succeeding; masterpieces are only lucky attempts. You may console
yourself for not achieving masterpieces, provided that your attempts are
conscientious."
"I am consoled beforehand," I answered, "and I am willing to begin again
whenever you wish; please give me your advice."
"For example," said he, "we were present last evening at a rustic
gathering at the farm, and the hemp-dresser told a story until two
o'clock in the morning. The priest's servant helped him with his tale,
and resumed it when he stopped; she was a peasant-woman of some slight
education; he was uneducated, but happily gifted by nature and endowed
with a certain rude eloquence. Between them they related a true story,
which was rather long, and like a simple kind of novel. Can you remember
it?"
"Perfectly, and I could repeat it word for word in their language."
"But their language would require a translation; you must write in your
own, without using a single word unintelligible enough to necessitate a
footnote for the reader."
"I see that you are setting an impossible task for me--a task into which
I have never plunged without emerging dissatisfied with myself, and
overcome with a sense of my own weakness."
"No matter, you must plunge in again, for I understand you artists; you
need obstacles to rouse your enthusiasm, and you never do well what is
plain and easy to you. Come, begin, tell me the story of the 'Waif,' but
not in the way that you and I heard it last night. That was a masterly
piece of narrative for you and me who are children of the soil. But tell
it to me as if you had on your right hand a Parisian speaking the modern
tongue, and on your left a peasant before whom you were unwilling to
utter a word or phrase which he could not understand. You must speak
dearly for the Parisian, and simply for the peasant. One will accuse you
of a lack of local color, and the other of a lack of elegance. But I
shall be listening too, and I am trying to discover by what means art,
without ceasing to be universal, can penetrate the mystery of primitive
simplicity, and interpret the charm of nature to the mind."
"This, then, is a study which we are going to undertake together?"
"Yes, for I shall interrupt you when you stumble."
"Very well, let us sit down on this bank covered with wild thyme. I will
begin; but first allow me to clear my voice with a few scales."
"What do you mean? I did not know that you could sing."
"I am only speaking metaphorically. Before beginning a work of art, I
think it is well to call to mind some theme or other to serve as a type,
and to induce the desired frame of mind. So, in order to prepare myself
for what you ask, I must recite the story of the dog of Brisquet, which
is short, and which I know by heart."
"What is it? I cannot recall it."
"It is an exercise for my voice, written by Charles Nodier, who tried
his in all possible keys; a great artist, to my thinking, and one who
has never received all the applause he deserved, because, among all his
varied attempts, he failed more often than he succeeded. But when a man
has achieved two or three masterpieces, no matter how short they may be,
he should be crowned, and his mistakes should be forgotten. Here is the
dog of Brisquet. You must listen."
Then I repeated to my friend the story of the "Bichonne," which moved
him to tears, and which he declared to be a masterpiece of style.
"I should be discouraged in what I am going to attempt," said I, "for
this Odyssey of the poor dog of Brisquet, which did not take five
minutes to recite, has no stain or blot; it is a diamond cut by the
first lapidary in the world--for Nodier is essentially a lapidary in
literature. I am not scientific, and must call sentiment to my aid.
Then, too, I cannot promise to be brief, for I know beforehand that my
study will fail in the first of all requisites, that of being short and
good at the same time."
"Go on, nevertheless," said my friend, bored by my preliminaries.
"This, then, is the history of '_François the Champi_'" I resumed, "and
I shall try to remember the first part without any alteration. It was
Monique, the old servant of the priest, who began."
"One moment," said my severe auditor, "I must object to your title.
_Champi_ is not French."
"I beg your pardon," I answered. "The dictionary says it is obsolete,
but Montaigne uses it, and I do not wish to be more French than the
great writers who have created the language. So I shall not call my
story 'François the Foundling,' nor 'François the Bastard,' but
'François the _Champi_'--that is to say, the Waif, the forsaken child
of the fields, as he was once called in the great world, and is still
called in our part of the country."

CHAPTER I
ONE morning, when Madeleine Blanchet, the young wife of the miller of
Cormouer, went down to the end of her meadow to wash her linen in the
fountain, she found a little child sitting in front of her washing-board
playing with the straw she used as a cushion for her knees. Madeleine
Blanchet looked at the child, and was surprised not to recognize him,
for the road which runs near by is unfrequented, and few strangers are
to be met with in the neighborhood.
"Who are you, my boy?" said she to the little boy, who turned
confidingly toward her, but did not seem to understand her question.
"What is your name?" Madeleine Blanchet went on, as she made him sit
down beside her, and knelt down to begin to wash.
"François," answered the child.
"François who?"
"Who?" said the child stupidly.
"Whose son are you?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know your father's name?"
"I have no father."
"Is he dead then?"
"I don't know."
"And your mother?"
"She is over there," said the child pointing to a poor little hovel which
stood at the distance of two gunshots from the mill, and the thatched
roof of which could be seen through the willows.
"Oh! I know," said Madeleine. "Is she the woman who has come to live
here, and who moved in last evening?"
"Yes," answered the child.
"And you used to live at Mers?"
"I don't know."
"You are not a wise child. Do you know your mother's name, at least?"
"Yes, it is Zabelle."
"Isabelle who? Don't you know her other name?"
"No, of course not."
"What you know will not wear your brains out," said Madeleine, smiling
and beginning to beat her linen.
"What do you say?" asked little François. Madeleine looked at him
again; he was a fine child, and had magnificent eyes. "It is a pity,"
she thought, "that he seems to be so idiotic. How old are you?" she
continued. "Perhaps you do not know that either."
The truth is that he knew no more about this than about the rest. He
tried his best to answer, ashamed to have the miller's wife think him so
foolish, and delivered himself of this brilliant reply:
"Two years old."
"Indeed?" said Madeleine, wringing out her linen, without looking at him
any more, "you are areal little simpleton, and nobody has taken the
trouble to teach you, my poor child. You are tall enough to be six years
old, but you have not the sense of a child of two."
"Perhaps," answered François. Then, making another effort, as if to
shake off the lethargy from his poor little mind, he said:
"Were you asking for my name? It is François the Waif."
"Oh! I understand now," said Madeleine, looking at him compassionately;
and she was no longer astonished that he was so dirty, ragged, and
stupid.
"You have not clothes enough," said she, "and the weather is chill; I am
sure that you must be cold."
"I do not know," answered the poor waif, who was so accustomed to
suffering that he was no longer conscious of it.
Madeleine sighed. She thought of her little Jeannie, who was only a year
old, and was sleeping comfortably in his cradle watched over by his
grand-mother, while this poor little waif was shivering all alone at the
fountain's brink, preserved from drowning only by the mercy of
Providence, for he was too foolish to know that he would die if he fell
into the water.
Madeleine, whose heart was full of kindness, felt the child's arm and
found it warm, although he shook from time to time, and his pretty face
was very pale.
"Have you any fever?" she asked.
"I don't know," answered the child, who was always feverish.
Madeleine Blanchet loosened the woolen shawl from her shoulders and
wrapped it round the waif, who let her have her way without showing
either surprise or pleasure. She picked up all the straw from under his
knees and made a bed for him, on which he soon fell asleep; then she
made haste to finish washing her little Jeannie's clothes, for she
nursed her baby and was anxious to return to him.
When her task was completed, the wet linen was twice as heavy as before,
and she could not carry it all. She took home what she could, and left
the rest with her wooden beater beside the water, intending to come back
immediately and wake up the waif. Madeleine Blanchet was neither tall
nor strong. She was a very pretty woman, with a fearless spirit and a
reputation for sense and sweetness.
As she opened the door of her house she heard the clattering of sabots
running after her over the little bridge above the mill-dam, and,
turning round, she saw the waif, who had caught up with her, and was
bringing her her beater, her soap, the rest of the linen, and her shawl.
"Oh!" said she, laying her hand on his shoulder, "you are not so foolish
as I thought, for you are obliging, and nobody who has a good heart can
be stupid. Come in, my child, come in and rest. Look at this poor little
boy! He is carrying a load heavier than himself! Here," said she to the
miller's old mother, who handed her her baby, rosy and smiling, "here
is a poor sick-looking waif. You understand fevers, and we must try to
cure him."
"Ah! that is the fever of poverty!" replied the old woman, as she looked
at François. "He could cure it with good soup, but he cannot get that.
He is the little waif that belongs to the woman who moved in yesterday.
She is your husband's tenant, Madeleine. She looks very wretched, and I
am afraid that she will not pay regularly."
Madeleine did not answer. She knew that her husband and her
mother-in-law were not charitable, and that they loved their money more
than their neighbor. She nursed her baby, and when the old woman had
gone out to drive home the geese, she took François by the hand, and,
holding Jeannie on her arm, went with them to Zabelle's.
Zabelle, whose real name was Isabelle Bigot, was an old maid of fifty,
as disinterested as a woman can be when she has nothing to live on, and
is in constant dread of starvation. She had taken François after he was
weaned, from a dying woman, and had brought him up ever since, for the
sake of the monthly payment of a few pieces of silver, and with the
expectation of making a little servant out of him. She had lost her
sheep, and was forced to buy others on credit, whenever she could obtain
it; for she had no other means of support than her little flock, and a
dozen hens, which lived at the expense of the parish. She meant
François to tend this poor flock along the roadsides, until he should
be old enough to make his first communion, after which she expected to
hire him out as best she could, either as a little swineherd or a
plowboy, and she was sure that if his heart were good he would give part
of his wages to his adopted mother.
Zabelle had come from Mers, the day after the feast of Saint Martin,
leaving her last goat behind her in payment of what she owed on her
rent, and had taken possession of the little cottage belonging to the
mill of Cormouer, without being able to offer any security beside her
pallet-bed, two chairs, a chest, and a few earthen vessels. The house
was so poor, so ill-protected from the weather, and of such trifling
value, that the miller was obliged to incur the risk of letting it to a
poor tenant, or to leave it unoccupied.
Madeleine talked with Zabelle, and soon perceived that she was not a bad
woman, and that she would do all in her power to pay the rent. She had
some affection for the waif, but she was so accustomed to see him suffer
and to suffer herself that she was at first more surprised than pleased
by the pity which the rich miller's wife showed for the forlorn child.
At last, after she had recovered from her astonishment, and understood
that Madeleine had not come to ask anything of her, but to do her a
kindness, she took courage, related her story, which was like that of
all the unfortunate, and thanked her warmly for her interest. Madeleine
assured her that she would do her best to help her, but begged her to
tell nobody, acknowledging that she was not her own mistress at home,
and could only afford her assistance in secret.
She left her woolen shawl with Zabelle, and exacted a promise from her
that she would cut it into a coat for the waif that same evening, and
not allow the pieces to be seen before they were sewed together. She
saw, indeed, that Zabelle consented reluctantly, thinking the shawl very
convenient for her own use, and so she was obliged to tell her that she
would do no more for her unless the waif were warmly clothed in three
days' time.
"Do you not suppose," she added, "that my mother-in-law, who is so
wide-awake, would recognize my shawl on your shoulders? Do you wish to
get me into trouble? You may count upon my helping you in other ways if
you keep your own counsel. Now, listen to me: your waif has the fever,
and he will die if you do not take good care of him."
"Do you think so?" said Zabelle. "I should be very sorry to lose him,
because he has the best heart in the world; he never complains, and is
as obedient as if he belonged to a respectable family. He is quite
different from other waifs, who are ill-tempered and unruly, and always
in mischief."
"That is only because they are rebuffed and ill-treated. If yours is
good, it is because you have been kind to him, you may be sure."
"That is true," rejoined Zabelle; "children are more grateful than
people think, and though this little fellow is not bright, he can be
very useful at times. Once, when I was ill last year, and he was only
five years old, he took as good care of me as if he were a grown-up
person."
"Listen," said the miller's wife: "you must send him to me every morning
and evening, at the hour when I give soup to my child. I shall make more
than is necessary, and the waif may eat what is left; nobody will pay
any attention."
"Oh! I shall not dare bring him to you, and he will never have enough
sense to know the right time himself."
"Let us arrange it in this way. When the soup is ready, I will put my
distaff on the bridge over the dam. Look, you can see it very well from
here. Then you must send the child over with a sabot in his hand, as if
he were coming to get a light for the fire; and if he eats my soup, you
will have all yours to yourself. You will both be better fed."
"That will do very well," answered Zabelle. "I see that you are a clever
woman, and that I am fortunate in coming here. I was very much afraid of
your husband, who has the reputation of being a hard man, and if I could
have gone elsewhere I should not have taken his house, especially as it
is in wretched repair, and the rent is high. But I see that you are kind
to the poor, and will help me to bring up my waif. Ah! if the soup could
only cure his fever! It would be a great misfortune to me to lose that
child! He brings me but little profit, for all that I receive from the
asylum goes for his support. But I love him as if he were my own child,
because I know that he is good, and will be of use to me later. Have you
noticed how well-grown he is for his age, and will soon be able to
work?"
Thus François the Waif was reared by the care and kindness of
Madeleine, the miller's wife. He soon recovered his health, for he was
strongly built, and any rich man in the country might have wished for a
son with as handsome a face and as well-knit a frame. He was as brave as
a man, and swam in the river like a fish, diving even under the
mill-dam; he feared neither fire nor water; he jumped on the wildest
colts and rode them without a halter into the pasture, kicking them with
his heels to keep them in the right path, and holding on to their manes
when they leaped the ditches. It was singular that he did all this in
his quiet, easy way, without saying anything, or changing his childlike
and somewhat sleepy expression.
It was on account of this expression that he passed for a fool; but it
is none the less true that if it were a question of robbing a magpie's
nest at the top of a lofty poplar, or of finding a cow that had strayed
far from home, or of killing a thrush with a stone, no child was bolder,
more adroit, or more certain of success than he. The other children
called it _luck_, which is supposed to be the portion of a waif in this
hard world. So they always let him take the first part in dangerous
amusements.
"He will never get hurt," they said, "because he is a waif. A kernel of
wheat fears the havoc of the storm, but a random seed never dies."
For two years all went well. Zabelle found means to buy a few sheep and
goats, though no one knew how. She rendered a good many small services
to the mill, and Cadet Blanchet, the miller, was induced to make some
repairs in her roof, which leaked in every direction. She was enabled to
dress herself and her waif a little better, and looked gradually less
poverty-stricken than on her arrival. Madeleine's mother-in-law made
some harsh comments on the disappearance of certain articles, and on the
quantity of bread consumed in the house, and once Madeleine was obliged
to plead guilty in order to shield Zabelle from suspicion; but, contrary
to his mother's expectation, Cadet Blanchet was hardly angry at all, and
seemed to wink at what his wife had done.
The secret of Cadet Blanchet's compliance was that he was still very
much in love with his wife. Madeleine was pretty, and not the least of a
coquette; he heard her praises sung everywhere. Besides, his affairs
were prosperous, and, as he was one of those men who are cruel only when
they are in dread of calamity, he was kinder to Madeleine than anybody
could have supposed possible. This roused Mother Blanchet's jealousy,
and she revenged herself by petty annoyances, which Madeleine bore in
silence, and without complaining to her husband.
It was the best way of putting an end to them, and no woman could be
more patient and reasonable in this respect than Madeleine. But they say
in our country that goodness avails less in the end than malice, and the
day came when Madeleine was rebuked and called to account for her
charities.
It was a year when the grain had been wasted by hail, and an overflow of
the river had spoiled the hay. Cadet Blanchet was not in a good humor,
and one day, as he was coming back from market with a comrade who had
just married a very beautiful girl, the latter said to him:
"You, too, were not to be pitied _in your day_, for your Madelon used to
be a very attractive girl."
"What do you mean by _my day_, and _Madelon used to be_? Do you think
that she and I are old? Madeleine is not twenty yet, and I am not aware
that she has lost her looks."
"Oh, no, I do not say so," replied the other. "Madeleine is certainly
still good-looking; but you know that when a woman marries so young you
cannot expect her to be pretty long. After she has nursed one child, she
is already worn; and your wife was never strong, for you see that she is
very thin, and has lost the appearance of health. Is the poor thing
ill?"
"Not that I know of. Why do you ask me?"
"Oh, I don't know. I think she looks sad, as if she suffered or had some
sorrow. A woman's bloom lasts no longer than the blossom of the vine. I
must expect to see my wife with a long face and sober expression. And we
men are only in love with our wives while we are jealous of them. They
exasperate us; we scold them and beat them sometimes; they are
distressed and weep; they stay at home and are afraid of us; then they
are bored and care no more about us. But we are happy, for we are the
masters. And yet, one fine morning, lo and behold, a man sees that if
nobody wants his wife, it is because she has grown ugly; so he loves her
no longer, and goes to court his neighbor's. It is his fate. Good
evening, Cadet Blanchet; you kissed my wife rather too warmly to-night;
I took note of it, though I said nothing. I tell you this to let you
know that she and I shall not quarrel over it, and that I shall try not
to make her as melancholy as yours, because I know my own character. If
I am ever jealous, I shall be cruel, and when I have no more occasion
for jealousy, I shall be still worse perhaps."
A good disposition profits by a good lesson; but, though active and
intelligent, Cadet Blanchet was too arrogant to keep his
self-possession. He came home with his head high and his eye bloodshot.
He looked at Madeleine as he had not done for a long time, and perceived
that she was pale and altered. He asked her if she were ill, so rudely
that she turned still paler, and answered in a faint voice that she was
quite well. He took offense, Heaven knows why, and sat down to the
table, desirous of seeking a quarrel. He had not long to wait for an
opportunity. They talked of the dearness of wheat, and Mother Blanchet
remarked, as she did every evening, that too much bread was eaten in the
house. Madeleine was silent. Cadet Blanchet wanted to make her
responsible for the waste, and the old woman declared that she had
caught the waif carrying away half a loaf that very morning. Madeleine
should have been indignant and held her own, but she could only cry.
Blanchet thought of what his companion had said to him, and was still
more irritated; and so it happened that from that day on, explain it as
you can, he no longer loved his wife, but made her wretched.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER II
HE made her wretched, and as he had never made her happy she was doubly
unlucky in her marriage. She had allowed herself to be married, at
sixteen, to this rough, red-faced man, who drank deeply on Sunday, was
in a fury all Monday, in bad spirits on Tuesday, and worked like a horse
all the rest of the week to make up for lost time, for he was
avaricious, and had no leisure to think of his wife. He was less
ill-tempered on Saturday, because he had finished his work, and expected
to amuse himself next day. But a single day of good humor in a week is
not enough, and Madeleine had no pleasure in seeing him merry, because
she knew that he would be sure to come home the next evening in a
passion.
But as she was young and pretty, and so gentle that it was impossible to
be angry long with her, there were still intervals when he was kind and
just, and when he took her hands in his and said:
"Madeleine, you are a good wife, and I think that you were made
expressly for me. If I had married a coquette, such as so many women
are, I should kill her, or I should drown myself under my own mill-wheel.
But I know that you are well-behaved and industrious, and that you are
worth your weight in gold."
After four years of married life, however, his love had quite gone; he
had no more kind words for her, and was enraged that she made no answer
to his abuse. What answer could she make? She knew that her husband was
unjust, and was unwilling to reproach him for it, for she considered it
her duty to respect the master whom she had never been able to love.
Mother Blanchet was pleased to see her son master of the house again, as
she said; just as if it had ever been otherwise. She hated her
daughter-in-law, because she knew her to be better than herself. When
she could find no other cause of complaint, she reviled her for not
being strong, for coughing all winter, and for having only one child.
She despised her for this, for knowing how to read and write, and for
reading prayers in a corner of the orchard, instead of gossiping and
chattering with the dames of the vicinity.
Madeleine placed her soul in God's hands, and thinking lamentations
useless, she bore her affliction as if it were her due. She withdrew her
heart from this earth, and often dreamed of paradise, as if she wished
to die. Still, she was careful of her health, and armed herself with
courage, because she knew that her child could only be happy through
her, and she accepted everything for the sake of the love she bore him.
Though she could not feel any great affection for Zabelle, she was still
fond of her, because this woman, who was half good and half selfish,
continued to do her best for the poor waif; and Madeleine, who saw how
people deteriorate who think of themselves alone, was inclined to esteem
only those who thought sometimes of others. As she was the only person
in the neighborhood who took no care of herself, she was entirely
isolated and very sorrowful, without fully understanding the cause of
her grief.
Little by little, however, she observed that the waif, who was then ten
years old, began to think as she did. When I say think, I mean you to
understand that she judged from his behavior; for there was no more
sense in the poor child's words than on the first day she had spoken
with him. He could not express himself, and when people tried to make
him talk they were sure to interrupt him immediately, for he knew
nothing about anything. But if he were needed to run an errand, he was
always ready, and when it was an errand for Madeleine, he ran before she
could ask him. He looked as if he had not understood the commission, but
he executed it so swiftly and well that even she was amazed.
One day, as he was carrying little Jeannie in his arms, and allowing him
to pull his hair for his amusement, Madeleine caught the child from him
with some slight irritation, saying half involuntarily:
"François, if you begin now by suffering all the whims of other people,
there is no knowing where they will stop."
To her great surprise, François answered:
"I should rather suffer evil than return it."
Madeleine was astonished, and gazed into the eyes of the waif, where she
saw something she had never observed in the eyes even of the most honest
persons she knew; something so kind, and yet so decided, that she was
quite bewildered. She sat down on the grass with her child on her knees,
and made the waif sit on the edge of her dress, without daring to speak
to him. She could scarcely understand why she was overcome with fear and
shame that she had often jested with this child for being so foolish. It
is true that she had always done so with extreme gentleness, and perhaps
she had pitied and loved him the more for his stupidity; but now she
fancied that he had always understood her ridicule, and had been pained
by it without being able to say anything in return.
She soon forgot this incident, for a short time afterward her husband,
who had become infatuated with a disreputable woman in the neighborhood,
undertook to hate his wife in good earnest, and to forbid her to allow
Zabelle and her boy to enter the mill. Madeleine fell to thinking of
still more secret means of aiding them, and warned Zabelle, telling her
that she should pretend to neglect her for a time.
Zabelle was very much in awe of the miller, and had not Madeleine's
power of endurance for the love of others. She argued to herself that
the miller was the master, and could turn her out of doors, or increase
her rent, and that Madeleine would be unable to prevent it. She
reflected also that if she submitted to Mother Blanchet, she would
establish herself in the good graces of the old woman, whose protection
would be more useful to her than that of the young wife. So she went to
the miller's mother, and confessed that she had received help from her
daughter-in-law, declaring that she had done so against her will, and
only out of pity for the waif, whom she had no means of feeding. The old
woman detested the waif, though for no reason except that Madeleine took
an interest in him. She advised Zabelle to rid herself of him, and
promised her at this price to obtain six months' credit on her rent. The
morrow of Saint Martin's day had come round, and as the year had been a
hard one, Zabelle was out of money, and Madeleine was so closely watched
that for some time she had been unable to give her any. Zabelle boldly
promised to take back the waif to the foundling asylum the next day.
She had no sooner given her word than she repented of it, and at the
sight of little François sleeping on his wretched pallet, her heart was
as heavy as if she were about to commit a mortal sin. She could not
sleep, and before dawn Mother Blanchet entered the hovel.
"Come, get up, Zabeau," she said. "You gave me your promise and you must
keep it. If you wait to speak to my daughter-in-law, you will never do
anything, but you must let the boy go, in her interest as well as your
own, you see. My son has taken a dislike to him on account of his
stupidity and greediness; my daughter-in-law has pampered him too much,
and I am sure that he is a thief already. All foundlings are thieves
from their birth, and it is mere folly to expect anything of such
brats. This one will be the cause of your being driven away from here,
and will ruin your reputation; he will furnish my son with a reason for
beating his wife every day, and in the end, when he is tall and strong,
he will become a highwayman, and will bring you to shame. Come, come,
you must start! Take him through the fields as far as Corley, and there
the stage-coach passes at eight o'clock. Get in with him, and you will
reach Châteauroux, at noon, at the latest. You can come back this
evening; there is a piece of money for your journey, and you will have
enough left over to amuse yourself with in town."
Zabelle woke the child, dressed him in his best, made a bundle of the
rest of his clothes, and, taking his hand, started off with him by the
light of the moon.
As she walked along and the day broke, her heart failed her; she could
neither hasten her steps, nor speak, and when she came to the highroad,
she sat down on the side of a ditch, more dead than alive. The
stage-coach was approaching, and they had arrived only just in time.
The waif was not in the habit of worrying, and thus far he had followed
his mother without suspicion; but when he saw a huge carriage bowling
toward him for the first time in his life, the noise it made frightened
him, and he tried to pull Zabelle back into the meadow which they had
just left to join the highroad. Zabelle thought that he understood his
fate, and said:
"Come, poor François, you really must!"
François was still more frightened. He thought that the stage-coach was
an enormous animal running after him to devour him. He who was so bold
in meeting all the dangers which he knew lost his head, and rushed back
screaming into the meadow. Zabelle ran after him; but when she saw him
pale as death, her courage deserted her. She followed him all across the
meadow, and allowed the stage-coach to go by.

THEY returned by the same road they had come, until they had gone half
the distance, and then they stopped to rest. Zabelle was alarmed to see
that the child trembled from head to foot, and his heart beat so
violently as to agitate his poor old shirt. She made him sit down, and
attempted to comfort him, but she did not know what she was saying, and
François was not in a state to guess her meaning. She drew out a bit of
bread from her basket and tried to persuade him to eat it; but he had no
desire for food, and they sat on for a long time in silence.
At last, Zabelle, who was in the habit of recurring to her first
thoughts, was ashamed of her weakness, and said to herself that she
would be lost if she appeared again at the mill with the child. Another
stage was to pass toward noon, and she decided to stay where they were
until the moment necessary for returning to the highroad; but as
François was so terrified that he had lost the little sense he
possessed, and as for the first time in his life he was capable of
resisting her will, she tried to tempt him with the attractions of the
horse's bells, the noise of the wheels, and the speed of the great
vehicle.
In her efforts to inspire him with confidence, she said more than she
intended; perhaps her repentance urged her to speak, in spite of
herself, or it may be that when François woke that morning he had heard
certain words of Mother Blanchet, which now returned to his mind; or
else his poor wits cleared suddenly at the approach of calamity; at all
events, he began to say, with the same expression in his eyes which had
once astonished and almost startled Madeleine:
"Mother, you want to send me away from you! You want to take me far off
from here and leave me."
Then he remembered the word asylum, spoken several times in his hearing.
He had no idea what an asylum was, but it seemed to him more horrible
than the stage-coach, and he cried with a shudder:
"You want to put me in the asylum!"
Zabelle had gone too far to retreat. She believed that the child knew
more of her intentions than he really did, and without reflecting how
easy it would be to deceive him and rid herself of him by stratagem, she
undertook to explain the truth to him, and to make him understand that
he would be much happier at the asylum than with her, that he would be
better cared for there, would learn to work, and would be placed for a
time in the charge of some woman less poor than herself, who would be a
mother to him.
This attempted consolation put the finishing touch to the waif's
despair. A strange and unknown future inspired him with more terror than
all Zabelle could say of the hardships of a life with her. Besides, he
loved with all his might this ungrateful mother, who cared less for him
than for herself. He loved another, too, almost as much as Zabelle, and
she was Madeleine; only he did not know that he loved her, and did not
speak of her. He threw himself sobbing on the ground, tore up the grass
with his hands and flung it over his face, as if he had fallen in mortal
agony. When Zabelle, in her distress and impatience, tried to make him
get up by force and threats, he beat his head so hard against the stones
that he was covered with blood, and she thought he was about to kill
himself.
It pleased God that Madeleine Blanchet should pass by at that moment.
She had heard nothing of the departure of Zabelle and the child, and was
coming home from Presles, where she had carried back some wool to a
lady, who had given it to her to spin very fine, as she was considered
the best spinster far and wide. She had received her payment, and was
returning to the mill with ten crowns in her pocket. She was going to
cross the river on one of those little plank bridges on a level with the
surface of the water, which are often to be met with in that part of the
country, when she heard heart-piercing shrieks, and recognized at once
the voice of the poor waif. She flew in the direction of the cries, and
saw the child, bathed in blood, struggling in Zabelle's arms. She could
not understand it at first; for it looked as if Zabelle had cruelly
struck him, and were trying to shake him off. This seemed the more
probable, as François, on catching sight of her, rushed toward her,
twined his arms about her like a little snake, and clung to her skirts,
screaming:
"Madame Blanchet, Madame Blanchet, save me!"
Zabelle was tall and strong, and Madeleine was small and slight as a
reed. Still, she was not afraid, and, imagining that Zabelle had gone
crazy, and was going to murder the child, she placed herself in front of
him, resolved to protect him or to die while he was making his escape.
A few words, however, sufficed for an explanation. Zabelle, who was more
grieved than angry, told the story, and François, who at last took in
all the sadness of his lot, managed this time to profit by what he
heard, with more cleverness than he had ever been supposed to possess.
After Zabelle had finished, he kept fast hold of the miller's wife,
saying:
"Don't send me away, don't let me be sent away."
And he went to and fro between Zabelle, who was crying, and the miller's
wife, who was crying still harder, repeating all kinds of words and
prayers, which scarcely seemed to come from his lips, for this was the
first time he had ever been able to express himself.
"O my mother, my darling mother!" said he to Zabelle, "why do you want
me to leave you? Do you want me to die of grief and never see you again?
What have I done, that you no longer love me? Have I not always obeyed
you? Have I done any harm? I have always taken good care of our
animals--you told me so yourself; and when you kissed me every evening,
you said I was your child, and you never said that you were not my
mother! Keep me, mother, keep me; I am praying to you as I pray to God!
I shall always take care of you; I shall always work for you; if you are
not satisfied with me, you may beat me, and I shall not mind; but do not
send me away until I have done something wrong."
Then he went to Madeleine, and said:
"Madame Blanchet, take pity on me. Tell my mother to keep me. I shall
never go to your house, since it is forbidden, and if you want to give
me anything, I shall know that I must not take it. I shall speak to
Master Cadet Blanchet, and tell him to beat me and not to scold you on
my account. When you go into the fields, I shall always go with you to
carry your little boy, and amuse him all day. I shall do all you tell
me, and if I do any wrong, you need no longer love me. But do not let me
be sent away; I do not want to go; I should rather jump into the river."
Poor François looked at the river, and ran so near it, that they saw
his life hung by a thread, and that a single word of refusal would be
enough to make him drown himself. Madeleine pleaded for the child, and
Zabelle was dying to listen to her. Now that she was near the mill,
matters looked differently.
"Well, I will keep you, you naughty child," said she; "but I shall be on
the road to-morrow, begging my bread because of you. You are too stupid
to know it is your fault that I shall be reduced to such a condition,
and this is what I have gained by burdening myself with a child who is
no good to me, and does not even pay for the bread he eats."
"You have said enough, Zabelle," said the miller's wife, taking the
child in her arms to lift him from the ground, although he was very
heavy. "There are ten crowns for you to pay your rent with, or to move
elsewhere, if my husband persists in driving you away from here. It is
my own money--money that I have earned myself. I know that it will be
required of me, but no matter. They may kill me if they want; I buy this
child, he is mine, he is yours no longer. You do not deserve to keep a
child with such a warm heart, and who loves you so much. I shall be his
mother, and my family must submit. I am willing to suffer everything for
my children. I could be cut in pieces for my Jeannie, and I could endure
as much for this child, too. Come, poor François, you are no longer a
waif, do you hear? You have a mother, and you can love her as much as
you choose, for she will love you with her whole heart in return."
Madeleine said all this without being perfectly aware of what she was
saying. She whose disposition was so gentle was now highly excited. Her
heart rebelled against Zabelle, and she was really angry with her.
François had thrown his arms round the neck of the miller's wife, and
clasped her so tight that she lost her breath; and at the same time her
cap and neckerchief were stained with blood, for his head was cut in
several places.
Madeleine was so deeply affected, and was filled with so much pity,
dismay, sorrow, and determination at once, that she set out to walk
toward the mill with as much courage as a soldier advancing under fire.
Without considering that the child was heavy, and she herself so weak
that she could hardly carry her small Jeannie, she attempted to cross
the unsteady little bridge that sank under her weight. When she reached
the middle, she stopped. The child was so heavy that she swerved
slightly, and drops of perspiration started from her forehead. She felt
as if she should fall from weakness, when suddenly she called to mind a
beautiful and marvelous story that she had read the evening before in an
old volume of the "Lives of the Saints." It was the story of Saint
Christopher, who carried the child Jesus across the river, and found him
so heavy that he stopped in fear. She looked down at the waif. His eyes
had rolled back in his head, and his arms had relaxed their hold. The
poor child had either undergone too much emotion, or he had lost too
much blood, and had fainted.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER IV
WHEN Zabelle saw him thus, she thought he was dead. All her love for him
returned, and with no more thought of the miller or his wicked old
mother, she seized the child from Madeleine, and began to kiss him, with
sobs and cries. They sat down beside the river, and, laying him across
their knees, they washed his wounds and stanched the blood with their
handkerchiefs; but they had nothing with which to bring him to.
Madeleine warmed his head against her bosom, and breathed on his face
and into his mouth as people do with the drowned. This revived him, and
as soon as he opened his eyes and saw what care they were taking of him,
he kissed Madeleine and Zabelle, one after the other, so passionately
that they were obliged to check him, fearing that he might faint again.
"Come, come," said Zabelle, "we must go home. No, I can never, never
leave that child; I see now, and I shall never think of it again. I
shall keep your ten crowns, Madeleine, so I can pay my rent to-night if
I am forced to do so. Do not tell about it; I shall go to-morrow to the
lady in Presles, so that she may not inform against you, and she can
say, in case of need, that she has not as yet given you the price of
your spinning. In this way we shall gain time, and I shall try so hard
that, even if I have to beg for it, I shall succeed in paying my debt to
you, so that you need not suffer on my account. You cannot take this
child to the mill; your husband would kill him. Leave him to me; I swear
to you that I shall take as good care of him as before, and if we are
tormented any further, we tan think of something else."
It came to pass that the waif's return was effected without disturbance,
and without exciting attention; for it happened that Mother Blanchet had
just fallen ill of a stroke of apoplexy, without having had an
opportunity of telling her son what she had exacted from Zabelle about
the waif, and Master Blanchet sent in all haste for Zabelle to come and
help in the household, while Madeleine and the servant were taking care
of his mother. For three days everything was in confusion at the mill.
Madeleine did not spare herself, and watched for three nights at the
bedside of her husband's mother, who died in her arms.
This blow allayed the miller's bad temper for some time. He had loved
his mother as much as he was capable of loving, and his vanity was
concerned in making as fine a funeral for her as his means allowed. He
forgot his mistress for the required time, and with pretended generosity
distributed his dead mother's clothes to the poor neighbors. Zabelle had
her share of the alms, and the waif received a franc piece, because
Blanchet remembered that once, when they were in urgent need of leeches
for the sick woman, and everybody was running futilely hither and
thither to look for them, the waif went off, without saying a word, to
fish some out of a pool where he knew they were, and brought them back
in less time than it took the others to start out for them.
So Cadet Blanchet gradually forgot his dislike, and nobody at the mill
knew of Zabelle's freak of sending back the waif to the asylum. The
question of Madeleine's ten crowns came up later, for the miller did not
neglect to make Zabelle pay the rent for her wretched cottage. Madeleine
said that she had lost them as she ran home through the fields, on
hearing of her mother-in-law's accident. Blanchet made a long search for
them and scolded a great deal, but he never found out the use to which
the money had been put, and Zabelle was not suspected.
After his mother's death, Blanchet's disposition changed little by
little, though not for the better. He found life still more tedious at
home, was less observant of what went on, and less niggardly in his
expenditure. He no longer earned anything, and, in proportion as he grew
fat, led a disorderly life, and cared no more for his work. He looked to
make his profit by dishonest bargains and unfair dealings, which would
have enriched him, if he had not spent on one hand what he gained on the
other. His mistress acquired more ascendency over him every day. She
took him with her to fairs and feasts, induced him to engage in petty
trickeries, and spend his time at the tavern. He learned how to gamble,
and was often lucky; but it would have been better for him to lose
always than acquire this unfortunate taste; for his dissipations threw
him entirely off his balance, and at the most trifling loss, he became
furious with himself, and ill-tempered toward everybody else.
While he was leading this wretched life, his wife, always wise and good,
governed the house and tenderly reared their only child. But she thought
herself doubly a mother, for she loved and watched over the waif almost
as much as if he were her own. As her husband became more dissolute, she
was less miserable and more her own mistress. In the beginning of his
licentious career he was still very churlish, because he dreaded
reproaches, and wished to hold his wife in a state of fear and
subjection. When he saw that she was by nature an enemy to strife, and
showed no jealousy, he made up his mind to leave her in peace. As his
mother was no longer there to stir him up against her, he was obliged to
recognize that no other woman was as thrifty as Madeleine. He grew
accustomed to spend whole weeks away from home, and whenever he came
back in the mood for a quarrel, he met with a mute patience that turned
away his wrath, and he was first astonished and ended by going to sleep.
So finally he came to see his wife only when he was tired and in need of
rest.
Madeleine must have been a very Christian woman to live thus alone with
an old servant and two children, and perhaps she was a still better
Christian than if she had been a nun. God had given her the great
privilege of learning to read, and of understanding what she read. Yet
she always read the same thing, for she possessed only two books, the
Holy Gospel and an abbreviated copy of the "Lives of the Saints." The
Gospel sanctified her, and saddened her to tears, when she read alone in
the evening beside her son's bed. The "Lives of the Saints" produced a
different effect upon her; it was just as when idle people read stories
and excite themselves over dreams and illusions. These beautiful tales
inspired her with courage and even gaiety. Sometimes, out in the fields,
the waif saw her smile and flush, when she had her book in her lap. He
wondered at it, and found it hard to understand how the stories which
she told him, with some little alteration in order adapt them to his
capacity (and also perhaps because she could not perfectly grasp them
from beginning to end), could come from that thing which she called her
book. He wanted to read, too, and learned so quickly and well that she
was amazed, and in his turn he was able to teach little Jeannie. When
François was old enough to make his first communion, Madeleine helped
him with his catechism, and the parish priest was delighted with the
intelligence and excellent memory of this child, who had always passed
for a simpleton, because he was very shy and never had anything to say.
After his first communion, and he was old enough to be hired out,
Zabelle was pleased to have him engaged as servant at the mill; and
Master Blanchet made no opposition, because it was plain to all that the
waif was a good boy, very industrious and obliging, and stronger, more
alert and sensible than the other children of his age. Then, too, he was
satisfied with ten crowns for wages, and it was an economical
arrangement for the miller. François was very happy to be entirely in
the service of Madeleine and the dear little Jeannie he loved so much,
and when he found that Zabelle could pay for her farm with his earnings,
and thus be relieved of her most besetting care, he thought himself as
rich as a king.
Unfortunately, poor Zabelle could not long enjoy her reward. At the
beginning of the winter, she fell seriously ill, and in spite of
receiving every care from the waif and Madeleine, she died on Candlemas
Day, after having so far recovered that they thought her well again.
Madeleine sorrowed and wept for her sincerely, but she tried to comfort
the poor waif, who but for her would have been inconsolable.
Even after a year's time, he still thought of her every day, and almost
every instant. Once he said to the miller's wife:
"I feel a kind of remorse when I pray for my poor mother's soul; it is
because I did not love her enough. I am very sure that I always did my
best to please her, that I never said any but kind words to her, and
that I served her in all ways as I serve you; but I must confess
something, Madame Blanchet, which troubles me, and for which, in secret,
I often ask God's forgiveness. Ever since the day my poor mother wanted
to send me back to the asylum, and you took my part, and prevented her
doing so, my love for her, against my will, grew less. I was not angry
with her; I did not allow myself even to think that she was wrong in
trying to rid herself of me. It was her right to do so; I stood in her
way; she was afraid of your mother-in-law, and after all she did it very
reluctantly; for I could see that she loved me greatly. In some way or
other, the idea keeps recurring to my mind, and I cannot drive it away.
From the moment you said to me those words which I shall never forget, I
loved you more than her, and in spite of all I could do, I thought of
you more often than of her. She is dead now, and I did not die of grief
as I should if you died!"
"What were the words I said, my poor child, that made you love me so
much? I do not remember them."
"You do not remember them?" said the waif, sitting down at the feet of
Madeleine, who was turning her wheel as she listened. "When you gave the
crowns to my mother, you said: 'There, I buy that child of you; he is
mine!' And then you kissed me and said: 'Now you are no longer a waif;
you have a mother who will love you as if you were her own!' Did not you
say so, Madame Blanchet?"
"If I did, I said what I meant, and am still of the same mind. Do you
think I have failed to keep my word?"
"Oh no! only--"
"Only what?"
"No. I cannot tell you, for it is wrong to complain and be thankless and
ungrateful."
"I know that you cannot be ungrateful, and I want you to say what you
have on your mind. Come, in what respect don't I treat you like my own
child? I order you to tell me, as I should order Jeannie."
"Well, it is--it is that you kiss Jeannie very often, and have never
kissed me since the day we were just speaking of. Yet I am careful to
keep my face and hands very clean, because I know that you do not like
dirty children, and are always running after Jeannie to wash and comb
him. But this does not make you kiss me any more, and my mother Zabelle
did not kiss me either. I see that other mothers caress their children,
and so I know that I am always a waif, and that you cannot forget it."
"Come and kiss me, François," said the miller's wife, making the child
sit on her knees and kissing him with much feeling. "It is true that I
did wrong never to think of it, and you deserved better of me. You see
now that I kiss you with all my heart, and you are very sure that you
are not a waif, are not you?"
The child flung his arms round Madeleine's neck, and turned so pale that
she was surprised, and putting him down gently from her lap, tried to
distract his attention. After a minute, he left her, and ran off to
hide. The miller's wife felt some uneasiness, and making a search for
him, she finally found him on his knees, in a corner of the barn, bathed
in tears.
"What does this mean, François?" said she, raising him up. "I don't
know what is the matter with you. If you are thinking of your poor
mother Zabelle, you had better say a prayer for her, and then you will
feel more at rest."
"No, no," said the child, twisting the end of Madeleine's apron, and
kissing it with all his might. "Are not you my mother?"
"Why are you crying then? You give me pain!"
"Oh, no! oh, no! I am not crying," answered François, drying his eyes
quickly, and looking up cheerfully; "I mean, I do not know why I was
crying. Truly, I cannot understand it, for I am as happy as if I were in
heaven."
[Illustration]
CHAPTER V
FROM that day on Madeleine kissed the child, morning and evening,
neither more nor less than if he had been her own, and the only
difference she made between Jeannie and François was that the younger
was the more petted and spoiled as became his age. He was only seven,
while the waif was twelve, and François understood perfectly that a big
boy like him could not be caressed like a little one. Besides, they were
still more unlike in looks than in years. François was so tall and
strong that he passed for fifteen, and Jeannie was small and slender
like his mother, whom he greatly resembled.
It happened one morning, when she had just received François's greeting
on her door-step, and had kissed him as usual, her servant said to her:
"I mean no offense, my good mistress, but it seems to me that boy is
very big to let you kiss him as if he were a little girl."
"Do you think so?" answered Madeleine, in astonishment. "Don't you know
how young he is?"
"Yes, and I should not see any harm in it, except that he is a waif, and
though I am only your servant, I would not be hired to kiss any such
riff-raff."
"What you say is wrong, Catherine," returned Madame Blanchet; "and above
all, you should not say it before the poor child."
"She may say it, and everybody else may say it, too," replied François,
boldly. "I don't care; if I am not a waif for you, Madame Blanchet, I am
very well satisfied."
"Only hear him!" said the servant. "This is the first time I ever knew
him to talk so much at once. Then you know how to put two or three words
together, do you, François? I really thought you could not even
understand what other people said. If I had known that you were
listening, I should not have spoken before you as I did, for I have no
idea of hurting your feelings. You are a good, quiet, obliging boy.
Come, you must not think of it any more; if it seems odd to me for our
mistress to kiss you, it is only because you are too big for it, and so
much coddling makes you look sillier than you really are."
Having tried to mend matters in this way, big Catherine set about making
her soup, and forgot all about what had passed.
The waif followed Madeleine to the place where she did her washing, and
sitting down beside her, he spoke as he knew how to speak with her and
for her alone.
"Do you remember, Madame Blanchet," said he, "how I was here once, long
ago, and you let me go to sleep in your shawl?"
"Yes, my child," said she, "it was the first time we ever saw each
other."
"Was it the first time? I was not certain, for I cannot recollect very
well; when I think of that time, it is all like a dream. How many years
ago is it?"
"It is--wait a minute--it is nearly six years, for my Jeannie was
fourteen months old."
"So I was not so old then as he is now? When he has made his first
communion, do you think he will remember all that is happening to him
now?"
"Oh! yes, I shall be sure to remember," cried Jeannie.
"That may be so or not," said François. "What were you doing yesterday
at this hour?"
Jeannie was startled, and opened his mouth to answer; then he stopped
short, much abashed.
"Well! I wager that you cannot give a better account of yourself,
either," said the miller's wife to François. She always took pleasure
in listening to the prattle of the two children.
"I?" said the waif, embarrassed, "wait a moment--I was going to the
fields, and passed by this very place--I was thinking of you. Indeed, it
was yesterday that the day when you wrapped me up in your shawl came
into my mind."
"You have a good memory, and it is surprising that you can remember so
far back. Can you remember that you were ill with fever?"
"No, indeed!"
"And that you carried home my linen without my asking you?"
"No."
"I have always remembered it, because that was the way I found out how
good your heart was."
"I have a good heart too, haven't I, mother?" said little Jeannie,
presenting his mother with an apple which he had half eaten.
"To be sure you have, and you must try to copy François in all the good
things you see him do."
"Oh, yes!" answered the child quickly, "I shall jump on the yellow colt
this evening, and shall ride it into pasture."
"Shall you?" said François, laughing. "Are you, too, going to climb up
the great ash-tree to hunt tomtits? I shall let you do it, my little
fellow! But listen, Madame Blanchet, there is something I want to ask of
you, but I do not know whether you will tell it to me."
"Let me hear."
"Why do they think they hurt my feelings when they call me a waif? Is
there any harm in being a waif?"
"No; certainly not, my child, since it is no fault of yours."
"Whose fault is it?"
"It is the fault of the rich people."
"The fault of the rich people! What does that mean?"
"You are asking a great many questions to-day; I shall answer you by and
by."
"No, no; right away, Madame Blanchet."
"I cannot explain it to you. In the first place, do you know yourself
what it is to be a waif?"
"Yes; it is being put in a foundling asylum by your father and mother,
because they have no money to feed you and bring you up."
"Yes, that is it. So you see that there are people so wretched as not to
be able to bring up their own children, and that is the fault of the
rich who do not help them."
"You are right!" answered the waif very thoughtfully. "Yet there are
some good rich people, since you are one, Madame Blanchet, and it is
only necessary to fall in their way."
[Illustration]
CHAPTER VI
NEVERTHELESS, the waif, who was always musing and trying to find reasons
for everything since he had learned to read and had made his first
communion, kept pondering over what Catherine had said to Madame
Blanchet about him; but it was in vain that he reflected, for he could
never understand why, now that he was growing older, he should no longer
kiss Madeleine. He was the most innocent boy in the world, and had no
suspicion of what boys of his age learn all too quickly in the country.
His great simplicity of mind was the result of his singular bringing-up.
He had never felt his position as a foundling to be a disgrace, but it
had made him very shy; for though he had not taken the title as an
insult, he was always surprised to find he possessed a characteristic
which made a difference between himself and those with whom he
associated. Foundlings are apt to be humbled by their fate, which is
generally thrust upon them so harshly that they lose early their
self-respect as Christians. They grow up full of hatred toward those who
brought them into the world, not to speak of those who helped them to
remain in it. It happened, however, that François had fallen into the
hands of Zabelle, who loved him and treated him with kindness, and
afterward he load met with Madeleine, who was the most charitable and
compassionate of women. She had been a good mother to him, and a waif
who receives affection is better than other children, just as he is
worse when he is abused and degraded.
François had never known any amusement or perfect content except when
in the company of Madeleine, and instead of running off with the other
shepherd-boys for his recreation, he had grown up quite solitary, or
tied to the apron-strings of the two women who loved him. Especially
when with Madeleine, he was as happy as Jeannie could be, and he was in
no haste to play with the other children, who were sure to call him a
waif, and with whom he soon felt himself a stranger, though he could not
tell why.
So he reached the age of fifteen without any knowledge of wrong or
conception of evil; his lips had never uttered an unclean word, nor had
his ears taken in the meaning of one. Yet, since the day that Catherine
had censured his mistress for the affection she showed him, the child
had the great good sense and judgment to forego his morning kiss from
the miller's wife. He pretended to forget about it, or perhaps to be
ashamed of being coddled like a little girl, as Catherine had said. But
at the bottom, he had no such false shame, and he would have laughed at
the idea, had he not guessed that the sweet woman he loved might incur
blame on his account. Why should she be blamed? He could not understand
it, and though he saw that he could never find it out by himself, he
shrank from asking Madeleine for an explanation. He knew that her
strength of love and kindness of heart had enabled her to endure the
carping of others; for he had a good memory, and recollected that
Madeleine had been upbraided, and had narrowly escaped blows in former
years because of her goodness to him.
Now, owing to his good instincts, he spared her the annoyance of being
rebuked and ridiculed on his account. He understood, and it is wonderful
that the poor child could understand, that a waif was to be loved only
in secret; and rather than cause any trouble to Madeleine, he would have
consented to do without her love.
He was attentive to his work, and as, in proportion as he grew older, he
had more to do, it happened that he was less and less with Madeleine. He
did not grieve for this, for, as he toiled, he said to himself that it
was for her, and that he would have his reward in seeing her at meals.
In the evening, when Jeannie was asleep and Catherine had gone to bed,
François still stayed up with Madeleine while she worked, and read
aloud to her, or talked with her. Peasants do not read very fast, so
that the two books they had were quite sufficient for them. When they
read three pages in an evening they thought it was a great deal, and
when the book was finished, so much time had passed since the beginning
that they could take it up again at the first page without finding it
too familiar. There are two ways of reading, and it may not be amiss to
say so to those persons who think themselves well educated. Those who
have much time to themselves and many books, devour so many of them and
cram so much stuff into their heads, that they are utterly confused; but
those who have neither leisure nor libraries are happy when a good book
foils into their hands. They begin it over again a thousand times
without weariness, and every time something strikes them which they had
not observed before. In the main, the idea is always the same, but it is
so much dwelt upon, so thoroughly enjoyed and digested, that the single
mind which possesses it is better fed and more healthy than thirty
thousand brains full of wind and twaddle. What I am telling you, my
children, I have from the parish priest, who knows all about it.
So these two persons lived happy with what they had to consume in the
matter of learning; and they consumed it slowly, helping each other to
understand and love all that makes us just and good. Thus they grew in
piety and courage; and they had no greater joy than to feel themselves
at peace with all the world, and to be of one mind at all times and in
all places, on the subject of the truth and the desire of holy living.

CHAPTER VII
MASTER BLANCHET was no longer particular concerning his household
expenses, because he had fixed the amount of money which he gave to his
wife every month for her housekeeping, and made it as little as
possible. Madeleine could, without displeasing him, deprive herself of
her own comfort in order to give alms to the poor about her; sometimes
a little wood, another time part of her own dinner, again some
vegetables, some clothing, some eggs, and so on. She spent all she had
in the service of her neighbors, and when her money was exhausted, she
did with her own hands the work of the poor, so as to save the lives of
those among them who were ill and worn out. She was so economical, and
mended her old clothes so carefully, that she appeared to live
comfortably; and yet she was so anxious that her family should not
suffer for what she gave away, that she accustomed herself to eat
scarcely anything, never to rest, and to sleep as little as possible.
The waif saw all this, and thought it quite natural; for it was in his
character, as well as in the education he received from Madeleine, to
feel the same inclination, and to be drawn toward the same duty.
Sometimes, only, he was troubled by the great hardships which the
miller's wife endured, and blamed himself for sleeping and eating too
much. He would gladly have spent the night sewing and spinning in her
place; and when she tried to pay him his wages, which had risen to
nearly twenty crowns, he refused to take them, and obliged her to keep
them without the miller's knowledge.
"If my mother Zabelle were alive," said he, "this money would be for
her. What do you expect me to do with it? I have no need of it, since
you take care of my clothes, and provide me with sabots. Keep it for
somebody more unfortunate than I am. You work so hard for the poor
already, and if you give money to me, you must work still harder. If you
should fall ill and die like poor Zabelle, I should like to know what
good it would do me to have my chest full of money. Would it bring you
back again, or prevent me from throwing myself in the river?"
"You do not know what you are talking about, my child," said Madeleine,
one day that this idea returned to his mind, as happened from time to
time. "It is not a Christian act to kill oneself, and if I should die,
it would be your duty to live after me to comfort and help my Jeannie.
Should not you do that for me?"
"Yes, as long as Jeannie was a child and needed my love. But afterward!
Do not let us speak of this, Madame Blanchet. I cannot be a good
Christian on this point. Do not tire yourself out, and do not die, if
you want me to live on this earth."
"You may set your mind at ease, for I have no wish to die. I am well. I
am hardened to work, and now I am even stronger than I was in my youth."
"In your youth!" exclaimed François in astonishment. "Are not you
young, then?"
And he was afraid lest she might have reached the age for dying.
"I think I never had time to be young," answered Madeleine, laughing
like one who meets misfortune bravely. "Now I am twenty-five years old,
and that is a good deal for a woman of my make; for I was not born
strong like you, my boy, and I have had sorrows which have aged me more
than years."
"Sorrows! Heavens, yes! I knew it very well, when Monsieur Blanchet used
to speak so roughly to you. God forgive me! I am not a wicked boy, yet
once when he raised his hand against you as if to strike you--Oh! he did
well to change his mind, for I had seized a flail,--nobody had noticed
me,--and I was going to fall upon him. But that was a long time ago,
Madame Blanchet, for I remember that I was much shorter than he then,
and now I can look right over his head. And now that he scarcely speaks
to you any more, Madame Blanchet, you are no longer unhappy, are you?"
"So you think I am no longer unhappy, do you?" said Madeleine rather
sharply, thinking how it was that there had never been any love in her
marriage. Then she checked herself, for what she was going to say was no
concern of the waif's, and she had no right to put such ideas into a
child's head.
"You are right," said she; "I am no longer unhappy. I live as I please.
My husband is much kinder to me; my son is well and strong, and I have
nothing to complain of."
"Then don't I enter into your calculations? I--"
"You? You are well and strong, too, and that pleases me."
"Don't I please you in any other way?"
"Yes, you are a good boy; you are always right-minded, and I am
satisfied with you."
"Oh! if you were not satisfied with me, what a scamp, what a
good-for-nothing I should be, after the way in which you have treated
me! But there is still something else which ought to make you happy, if
you think as I do."
"Very well, tell me; for I do not know what puzzle you are contriving
for me."
"I mean no puzzle, Madame Blanche! I need but look into my heart, and I
see that even if I had to suffer hunger, thirst, heat, and cold, and
were to be beaten half to death every day into the bargain, and then had
only a bundle of thorns or a heap of stones to lie on--well, can you
understand?"
"I think so, my dear François; you could be happy in spite of so much
evil if only your heart were at peace with God."
"Of course that is true, and I need not speak of it. But I meant
something else."
"I cannot imagine what you are aiming at, and I see that you are
cleverer than I am."
"No, I am not clever. I mean that I could suffer all the pains that a man
living mortal life can endure, and could still be happy if I thought
Madame Blanchet loved me. That is the reason why I just said to you that
if you thought as I did, you would say: 'François loves me, and I am
content to be alive.'"
"You are right, my poor dear child," answered Madeleine; "and the things
you say to me sometimes make me want to cry. Yes, truly, your affection
for me is one of the joys of my life, and perhaps the greatest,
after--no, I mean with my Jeannie's. As you are older than he, you can
understand better what I say to you, and you can better explain your
thoughts to me. I assure you that I am never wearied when I am with both
of you, and the only prayer I make to God is that we may long be able to
live together as we do now, without separating."
"Without separating, I should think so!" said François. "I should
rather be cut into little pieces than leave you. Who else would love me
as you have loved me? Who would run the danger of being ill-treated for
the sake of a poor waif, and who would call me her child, her dear son?
For you call me so often, almost always. You often say to me when we are
alone: 'Call me _mother_, and not always Madame Blanchet.' I do not dare
to do so, because I am afraid of becoming accustomed to it and letting
it slip out before somebody."
"Well, even if you did so?"
"Oh! you would be sure to be blamed for it, and I do not like to have
you tormented on my account. I am not proud, and I do not care to have
it known that you have raised me from my orphan estate. I am satisfied
to know, all by myself, that I have a mother and am her child. Oh! you
must not die, Madame Blanchet," added poor François, looking at her
sadly, for his thoughts had long been running on possible calamity. "If
I lost you, I should have no other friend on this earth; you would go
straight into Paradise, and I am not sure that I deserve ever to receive
the reward of going there with you."
François had a kind of foreboding of heavy misfortune in all he said
and thought, and some little time afterward the misfortune fell.
He had become the servant of the mill, and it was his duty to make the
round of the customers of the mill, to carry their corn away on his
horse, and return it to them in flour. This sometimes obliged him to
take long rides, and for this same purpose he often visited Blanchet's
mistress, who lived about a league from the mill. He was not at all fond
of this commission, and would never linger an instant in her house after
her corn was weighed and measured.
*     *     *     *     *     *     *     *
At this point of the tale the narrator stopped.
"Are you aware that I have been talking a long time?" said she to her
friends, who were listening. "My lungs are not so strong as they once
were, and I think that the hemp-dresser, who knows the story better than
I, might relieve me, especially as we have just come to a place that I
do not remember so well."
"I know why your memory is not so good in the middle as in the
beginning," answered the hemp-dresser. "It is because the waif is about
to get into trouble, and you cannot stand it, because you are
chicken-hearted about love stories, like all other pious women."
"Is this going to turn into a love story?" asked Sylvine Courtioux, who
happened to be present.
"Good!" replied the hemp-dresser. "I knew that if I let out that word,
all the young girls would prick up their ears. But you must have
patience; the part of the story which I am going to take up on condition
that I may carry it to a happy close is not yet what you want to hear.
Where had you come to, Mother Monique?"
"I had come to Blanchet's mistress."
"That was it," said the hemp-dresser. The woman was called Sévère, but
her name was not well suited to her, for there was nothing to match it
in her disposition. She was very clever about hoodwinking people when
she wanted to get money out of them. She cannot be called entirely bad,
for she was of a joyous, careless temper; but she thought only of
herself, and cared not at all for the loss of others, provided that she
had all the finery and recreation she wanted. She had been the fashion
in the country, and it was said that she had found many men to her
taste. She was still a very handsome, buxom woman, alert though stout,
and rosy as a cherry. She paid but little attention to the waif, and if
she met him in her barn or courtyard she made fun of him with some
nonsense or other, but without malicious intent and for the pleasure of
Seeing him blush; for he blushed like a girl, and was ill at ease
whenever she spoke to him. He thought her brazen, and she seemed both
ugly and wicked in his eyes, though she was neither one nor the other;
at least, she was only spiteful when she was crossed in her interests or
her vanity, and I must even acknowledge that she liked to give almost as
much as to receive. She was ostentatiously generous, and enjoyed being
thanked; but to the mind of the waif she was a devil, who reduced Madame
Blanchet to want and drudgery.
Nevertheless, it happened that when the waif was seventeen years old,
Madame Sévère discovered that he was a deucedly handsome fellow. He was
not like most country boys, who, at his age, are dumpy and thick-set,
and only develop into something worth looking at two or three years
later. He was already tall and well-built; his skin was white, even at
harvest-time, and his tight curling hair was brown at the roots and
golden at the ends.
"Do you admire that sort of thing, Madame Monique? I mean the hair,
without any reference to boys."
"That is no business of yours," answered the priest's servant. "Go on
with your story."
He was always poorly dressed, but he loved cleanliness, as Madeleine
Blanchet had taught him; and such as he was, he had an air that no one
else had. Sévère noticed this little by little, and finally she was so
well aware of it that she took it into her head to thaw him out a
little. She was not a woman of prejudice, and when she heard anybody
say, "What a pity that such a handsome boy should be a waif!" she
answered, "There is every reason that waifs should be handsome, for love
brought them into the world."
She devised the following plan for being in his company. She made
Blanchet drink immoderately at the fair of Saint-Denis-de-Jouhet, and
when she saw that he was no longer able to put one foot before the
other, she asked the friends she had in the place to put him to bed.
Then she said to François, who had come with his master to drive his
animals to the fair:
"My lad, I am going to leave my mare for your master to return with
to-morrow morning; you may mount his and take me home on the crupper."
This arrangement was not at all to François's taste. He said that the
mare that belonged to the mill was not strong enough to carry two
people, and he offered to accompany Sévère home, if she rode her own
horse and allowed him to ride Blanchet's. He promised to come back
immediately with a fresh mount for his master, and to reach
Saint-Denis-de-Jouhet early the next morning; but Sévère would listen
to him no more than the wind, and ordered him to obey her. François was
afraid of her; for, as Blanchet saw with no eyes but hers, she could
have him sent away from the mill if he displeased her, especially as the
feast of Saint-Jean was near at hand. So he took her up behind him,
without suspecting, poor fellow, that this was not the best means of
escaping his evil destiny.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER VIII
IT was twilight when they set out, and when they passed the sluice of
the pond of Rochefolle night had already fallen. The moon had not yet
risen above the trees, and in that part of the country the roads are so
washed by numerous springs that they are not at all good. François
spurred his mare on to speed, for he disliked the company of Sévère,
and longed to be with Madame Blanchet.
But Sévère, who was in no haste to reach home, began to play the part
of a fine lady, saying that she was afraid, and that the mare must not
go faster than a walk, because she did not lift her legs well and might
stumble at any minute.
"Bah!" said François without paying any attention; "then it would be
the first time she said her prayers, for I never saw a mare so
disinclined to piety!"
"You are witty, François," said Sévère giggling, as if François had
said something very new and amusing.
"Oh, no indeed!" answered the waif, who thought she was laughing at him.
"Come," said she, "you surely cannot mean to trot down-hill?"
"You need not fear, for we can trot perfectly well."
The trot down-hill stopped the stout Sévère's breath, and prevented
her talking. She was extremely vexed, as she had expected to coax the
young man with her soft words, but she was unwilling to let him see that
she was neither young nor slender enough to stand fatigue, and was
silent for a part of the way.
When they came to a chestnut grove, she took it into her head to say:
"Stop, François; you must stop, dear François. The mare has just lost
a shoe."
"Even if she has lost a shoe," said François, "I have neither hammer
nor nails to put it on with."
"But we must not lose the shoe. It is worth something! Get down, I say,
and look for it."
"I might look two hours for it, among these ferns, without finding it.
And my eyes are not lanterns."
"Oh, yes, François," said Sévère, half in jest and half in earnest;
"your eyes shine like glowworms."
"Then you can see them through my hat, I suppose?" answered François,
not at all pleased with what he took for derision.
"I cannot see them just now," said Sévère with a sigh as big as
herself; "but I have seen them at other times!"
"You can never have seen anything amiss in them," returned the innocent
waif. "You may as well leave them alone, for they have never looked
rudely at you and never will."
"I think," broke in at this moment the priest's servant, "that you might
skip this part of the story. It is not very interesting to hear all the
bad devices of this wicked woman, for ensnaring our waif."
"Put yourself at ease, Mother Monique," replied the hemp-dresser. "I
shall skip as much as is proper. I know that I am speaking before young
people, and I shall not say a word too much."
We were just speaking of François's eyes, the expression of which
Sévère was trying to make less irreproachable than he had declared it
to be.
"How old are you, François?" said she with more politeness, so as to
let him understand that she was no longer going to treat him like a
little boy.
"Oh, Heavens! I don't know exactly," answered the waif, beginning to
perceive her clumsy advances. "I do not often amuse myself by reckoning
my years."
"I heard that you were only seventeen," she resumed, "but I wager that
you must be twenty, for you are tall, and will soon have a beard on your
chin."
"It is all the same to me," said François, yawning.
"Take care! You are going too fast, my boy. There! I have just lost my
purse!"
"The deuce you have!" said François, who had not as yet discovered how
shy she was. "Then I suppose that you must get off and look for it, for
it maybe of value."
He jumped down and helped her to dismount. She took pains to lean
against him, and he found her heavier than a sack of corn.
While she pretended to search for the purse, which was all the time in
her pocket, he went on five or six steps, holding the mare by the
bridle.
"Are not you going to help me look for it?" said she.
"I must hold the mare," said he, "for she is thinking of her colt, and
if I let her loose she will run home."
Sévère looked under the mare's leg, close beside François, and from
this he saw that she had lost nothing except her senses.
"We had not come as far as this," said he, "when you called out that you
had lost your purse. So you certainly cannot find it here."
"Do you think I am shamming, you rogue?" said she, trying to pull his
ear; "for I really believe that you are a rogue."
François drew back, as he was in no mood for a frolic.
"No, no," said he, "if you have found your money, let us go, for I
should rather be asleep than stay here jesting."
"Then we can talk," said Sévère, when she was seated again behind him;
"they say that beguiles the weariness of the road."
"I need no beguiling," answered the waif, "for I am not weary."
"That is the first pretty speech you have made me, François!"
"If it is a pretty speech, I made it by accident, for I do not
understand that sort of thing."
Sévère was exasperated, but she would not as yet give in to the truth.
"The boy must be a simpleton," said she to herself. "If I make him lose
his way, he will have to stay a little longer with me."
So she tried to mislead him, and to induce him to turn to the left when
he was going to the right.
"You are making a mistake," said she; "this is the first time you have
been over this road. I know it better than you do. Take my advice, or
you will make me spend the night in the woods, young man!"
When François had once been over a road, he knew it so perfectly that
he could find his way in it at the end of a year.
"No, no," said he, "this is the right way, and I am not in the least out
of my head. The mare knows it too, and I have no desire to spend the
night rambling about the woods."
Thus he reached the farm of Dollins, where Sévère lived, without
losing a quarter of an hour and without giving an opening as wide as the
eye of a needle to her advances. Once there, she tried to detain him,
insisting that the night was dark, that the water had risen, and that he
would have difficulty in crossing the fords. The waif cared not a whit
for these dangers, and, bored with so many foolish words, he struck the
mare with his heels, galloped off without waiting to hear the rest, and
returned swiftly to the mill, where Madeleine Blanchet was waiting for
him, grieved that he should come so late.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER IX
THE waif never told Madeleine what Sévère had given him to understand;
he would not have dared, and indeed dared not even think of it himself.
I cannot say that I should have behaved as discreetly as he in such an
adventure; but a little discretion never does any harm, and then I am
telling things as they happened. This boy was as refined as a
well-brought-up girl.
As Madame Sévère thought over the matter at night, she became incensed
against him, and perceived that he had scorned her and was not the fool
she had taken him for. Chafing at this thought, her spleen rose, and
great projects of revenge passed through her head.
So much so that when Cadet Blanchet, still half drunk, returned to her
next morning, she gave him to understand that his mill-boy was a little
upstart, whom she had been obliged to hold in check and cuff in the
face, because he had taken it into his head to make love to her and kiss
her as they came home together through the wood at night.
This was more than enough to disorder Blanchet's wits; but she was not
yet satisfied, and jeered at him for leaving at home with his wife a
fellow who would be inclined by his age and character to beguile the
dullness of her life.
In the twinkling of an eye, Blanchet was jealous both of his mistress
and his wife. He seized his heavy stick, pulled his hat down over his
eyes, like an extinguisher on a candle, and rushed off to the mill,
without stopping for breath.
Fortunately, the waif was not there. He had gone away to fell and saw up
a tree that Blanchet had bought from Blanchard of Guérin, and was not
to return till evening. Blanchet would have gone to find him at his
work, but he shrank from showing his fury before the young millers of
Guérin, lest they should make sport of him for his jealousy, which was
unreasonable after his long neglect and contempt of his wife.
He would have stayed to wait for his return, but he thought it too
wearisome to stay all day at home, and he knew that the quarrel which he
wished to pick with his wife could not last long enough to occupy him
till evening. It is impossible to be angry very long when the ill-temper
is all on one side.
In spite of this, however, he could have endured all the derision and
the tedium for the pleasure of belaboring the poor waif; but as his walk
had cooled him to some degree, he reflected that this cursed waif was no
longer a child, and that if he were old enough to think of making love,
he was also old enough to defend himself with blows, if provoked. So he
tried to gather his wits together, drinking glass after glass in
silence, revolving in his brain what he was going to say to his wife,
but did not know how to begin.
He had said roughly, on entering, that he wished her to listen to
something; so she sat near him, as usual sad, silent, and with a tinge
of pride in her manner.
"Madame Blanchet," said he at last, "I have a command to give you, but
if you were the woman you pretend to be, and that you have the
reputation of being, you would not wait to be told."
There he halted as if to take breath, but the fact is that he was almost
ashamed of what he was going to say, for virtue was written on his
wife's face as plainly as a prayer in a missal.
Madeleine would not help him to explain himself. She did not breathe a
word, but waited for him to go on, expecting him to find fault with her
for some expenditure, for she had no suspicion of what he was
meditating.
"You behave as if you did not understand me, Madame Blanchet," continued
the miller, "and yet my meaning is clear. You must throw that rubbish
out of doors, the sooner the better, for I have had enough and too much
of all this sort of thing."
"Throw what?" asked Madeleine, in amazement.
"Throw what! Then you do not dare to say throw _whom_?"
"Good God! no; I know nothing about it," said she. "Speak, if you want
me to understand you."
"You will make me lose my temper," cried Cadet Blanchet, bellowing like
a bull. "I tell you that waif is not wanted in my house, and if he is
still here by to-morrow morning, I shall turn him out of doors by main
force, unless he prefer to take a turn under my mill-wheel."
"Your words are cruel, and your purpose is very foolish, Master
Blanchet," said Madeleine, who could not help turning as white as her
cap. "You will ruin your business if you send the boy away; for you will
never find another who will work so well, and be satisfied with such
small wages. What has the poor child done to make you want to drive him
away so cruelly?"
"He makes a fool of me, I tell you, Madame Wife, and I do not intend to
be the laughing-stock of the country. He has made himself master of my
house, and deserves to be paid with a cudgel for what he has done."
It was some time before Madeleine could understand what her husband
meant. She had not the slightest conception of it, and brought forward
all the reasons she could think of to appease him and prevent his
persisting in his caprice.
It was all labor lost, for he only grew the more furious; and when he
saw how grieved she was to lose her good servant François, he had a
fresh access of jealousy, and spoke so brutally that his meaning dawned
on her at last, and she began to cry from mortification, injured pride,
and bitter sorrow.
This did not mend matters; Blanchet swore that she was in love with this
bundle of goods from the asylum, that he blushed for her, and that if
she did not turn the waif out of doors without delay, he would kill him
and grind him to powder.
Thereupon she answered more haughtily than was her wont, that he had the
right to send away whom he chose from his house, but not to wound and
insult his faithful wife, and that she would complain to God and all the
saints of Heaven of his cruel and intolerable injustice. Thus, in spite
of herself, she came gradually to reproach him with his evil behavior,
and confronted him with the plain feet that if a man is dissatisfied
with his own cap, he tries to throw his neighbor's into the mud.
It went from bad to worse, and when Blanchet finally perceived that he
was in the wrong, anger was his only resource. He threatened to shut
Madeleine's mouth with a blow, and would have done so, if Jeannie had
not heard the noise and come running in between them, without
understanding what the matter was, but quite pale and discomfited by so
much wrangling. When Blanchet ordered him away, the child cried, and his
father took occasion to say that he was ill-brought-up, a cry-baby, and
a coward, and that his mother would never be able to make anything out
of him. Then Blanchet plucked up courage, and rose, brandishing his
stick, and swearing that he would kill the waif.
When Madeleine saw that he was mad with passion, she threw herself
boldly in front of him, and he, disconcerted and taken by surprise,
allowed her her way. She snatched his stick out of his hands and threw
it far off into the river, and then, standing her ground, she said:
"You shall not ruin yourself by obeying this wicked impulse. Reflect
that calamity is swift to follow a man who loses his self-control, and
if you have no feeling for others, think of yourself and the probable
consequences of a single bad action. For a long time you have been
guiding your life amiss, my husband, and now you are hastening faster
and faster along a dangerous road. I shall prevent you, at least for
to-day, from committing a worse crime, which would bring its punishment
both in this world and the next. You shall not kill; return to where you
came from, rather than persevere in trying to revenge yourself for an
affront which was not offered. Go away; I command you to do so in your
own interest, and this is the first time in my life that I have ever
commanded you to do anything. You will obey me, because you will see
that I still observe the deference I owe you. I swear to you on my word
and honor that the waif shall not be here to-morrow, and that you may
come back without any fear of meeting him."
Having said this, Madeleine opened the door of the house for her
husband, and Cadet Blanchet, baffled by the novelty of her manner, and
pleased in the main to receive her submission without danger to his
person, clapped his hat upon his head, and without another word, returned
to Sévère. He did not fail to boast to her and to others that he had
administered a sound thrashing to his wife and to the waif; but as this
was not true, Sévère's pleasure evaporated in smoke.
When Madeleine Blanchet was alone again, she sent Jeannie to drive the
sheep and the goat to pasture, and went off to a little lonely nook
beside the mill-dam, where the earth was much eaten away by the force of
the current, and the place so crowded with a fresh growth of branches
above the old tree-stumps that you could not see two steps away from
you. She was in the habit of going there to pray, for nobody could
interrupt her, and she could be as entirely concealed behind the tall
weeds as a water-hen in its nest of green leaves.
As soon as she reached there, she sank on her knees to seek in prayer
the relief she so needed. But though she hoped this would bring great
comfort, she could think of nothing but the poor waif, who was to be
sent sway, and who loved her so that he would die of grief. So nothing
came to her lips, except that she was most unhappy to lose her only
support and separate herself from the child of her heart. Then she cried
so long and so bitterly that she was suffocated, and, falling full
length along the grass, lay unconscious for more than an hour, and it is
a miracle that she ever came to herself.
At nightfall she made an effort to collect her powers; and when she
heard Jeannie come home singing with the flock, she rose with difficulty
and set about preparing supper. Shortly afterward, she heard the noise
of the return of the oxen, who were drawing home the oak-tree that
Blanchet had bought, and Jeannie ran joyfully to meet his friend
François, whose presence he had missed all day. Poor little Jeannie had
been grieved for a moment by his father's cruel behaviour to his dear
mother, and he had run off to cry in the fields, without knowing what
the quarrel could be. But a child's sorrow lasts no longer than the dew
of the morning, and he had already forgotten his trouble. He took
François by the hand, and skipping as gaily as a little partridge,
brought him to Madeleine.
There was no need for the waif to look twice to see that her eyes were
reddened and her face blanched.
"Good God," thought he, "some misfortune has happened." Then he turned
pale too, and trembled, fixing his eyes on Madeleine, and expecting her
to speak to him. She made him sit down, and set his meal before him in
silence, but he could not swallow a mouthful. Jeannie eat and prattled
on by himself; he felt no uneasiness, for his mother kissed him from
time to time and encouraged him to make a good supper.
When he had gone to bed, and the servant was putting the room in order,
Madeleine went out, and beckoned François to follow her. She walked
through the meadow as far as the fountain, and then calling all her
courage to her aid, she said:
"My child, misfortune has fallen upon you and me, and God strikes us
both a heavy blow. You see how much I suffer, and out of love for me,
try to strengthen your own heart, for if you do not uphold me, I cannot
tell what will become of me."
François guessed nothing, although he at once supposed that the trouble
came from Monsieur Blanchet.
"What are you saying?" said he to Madeleine, kissing her hands as if she
were his mother. "How can you think that I shall not have courage to
comfort and sustain you? Am not I your servant for as long as I have to
stay upon the earth? Am not I your child, who will work for you, and is
now strong enough to keep you from want. Leave Monsieur Blanchet alone,
let him squander his money, since it is his choice. I shall feed and
clothe both you and our Jeannie. If I must leave you for a time, I shall
go and hire myself out, though not far from here, so that I can see you
every day, and come and spend Sundays with you. I am strong enough now
to work and earn all the money you need. You are so careful and live on
so little. Now you will not be able to deny yourself so many things for
others, and you will be the better for it. Come, Madame Blanchet, my
dear mother, calm yourself and do not cry, or I think I shall die of
grief."
When Madeleine saw that he had not understood, and that she must tell
him everything, she commended her soul to God, and made up her mind to
inflict this great pain upon him.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER X
"NO, François, my son," said she, "that is not it. My husband is not
yet ruined, as far as I know anything of his affairs, and if it were
only the fear of want, you would not see me so unhappy. Nobody need
dread poverty who has courage to work. Since you must hear why it is
that I am so sick at heart, let me tell you that Monsieur Blanchet is in
a fury against you, and will no longer endure your presence in his
house."
"Is that it?" cried François, springing up. "He may as well kill me
outright, as I cannot live after such a blow. Yes, let him put an end to
me, for he has long disliked me and longed to have me die, I know. Let
me see, where is he? I will go to him and say, 'Tell me why you drive me
away, and perhaps I can prove to you that you are mistaken in your
reasons. But if you persist, say so, that--that--' I do not know what I
am saying, Madeleine; truly, I do not know; I have lost my senses, and I
can no longer see clearly; my heart is pierced and my head is turning I
am sure I shall either die or go mad."
The poor waif threw himself on the ground, and struck his head with his
fists, as he had done when Zabelle had tried to take him back to the
asylum.
When Madeleine saw this, her high spirit returned. She took him by the
hands and arms, and shaking him, forced him to listen to her.
"If you have no more resignation and strength of will than a child,"
said she, "you do not deserve my love, and you will shame me for
bringing you up as my son. Get up. You are a man in years, and a man
should not roll on the ground, as you are doing. Listen, François, and
tell me whether you love me enough to go without seeing me for a time.
Look, my child, it is for my peace and good name, for otherwise my
husband will subject me to annoyance and humiliation. So you must leave
me to-day, out of love, just as I have kept you, out of love, to this
day; for love shows itself in different ways according to time and
circumstance. You must leave me without delay, because, in order to
prevent Monsieur Blanchet from committing a crime, I promised that you
should be gone to-morrow morning. To-morrow is Saint John's day, and you
must go and find a place; but not too near at hand, for if we were able
to see each other every day, it would be all the worse in Monsieur
Blanchet's mind."
"What has he in his mind, Madeleine? Of what does he complain? How have
I behaved amiss? Does he think that you rob the house to help me? That
cannot be, because now I am one of his household. I eat only enough to
satisfy my hunger, and I do not steal a pin from him. Perhaps he thinks
that I take my wages, and that I cost him too much. Very well, let me
follow out my purpose of going to explain to him that since my poor
mother Zabelle died, I have never received a single penny; or, if you do
not want me to tell him this,--and indeed if he knew it, he would try to
make you pay back all the money due on my wages that you have spent in
charity--well, I will make him this proposition for the next year. I
will offer to remain in your service for nothing. In this way he cannot
think me a burden, and will allow me to stay with you."
"No, no, no, François," cried Madeleine, hastily, "it is not possible;
and if you said this to him, he would fly into such a rage with you and
me that worse would come of it."
"But why?" asked François; "what is he angry about? Is it only for the
pleasure of making us unhappy that he pretends to mistrust me?"
"My child, do not ask the reason of his anger for I cannot tell you. I
should be too much ashamed, and you had better not even try to guess;
but I can assure you that your duty toward me is to go away. You are
tall and strong, and can do without me; and you will earn your living
better elsewhere, as long as you will take nothing from me. All sons
have to leave their mothers when they go out to work, and many go far
away. You must go like the rest, and I shall grieve as all mothers do. I
shall weep for you and think of you, and pray God morning and evening to
shield you from all ill."
"Yes, and you will take another servant who will serve you ill, who will
take no care of your son or your property, who will perhaps hate you, if
Monsieur Blanchet orders him not to obey you, and will repeat and
misrepresent to him all the kind things you do. You may be unhappy, and
I shall not be with you to protect and comfort you. Ah! you think that I
have no courage because I am miserable? You believe that I am thinking
only of myself, and tell me that I shall earn more money elsewhere! I am
not thinking of myself at all. What is it to me whether I gain or lose?
I do not even care to know whether I shall be able to control my
despair. I shall live or die as may please God, and it makes no
difference to me, as long as I am prevented from devoting my life to
you. What gives me intolerable anguish is that I see trouble ahead for
you. You will be trampled upon in your turn, and if Monsieur Blanchet
puts me out of the way, it is that he may the more easily walk over your
rights."
"Even if God permits this," said Madeleine, "I must bear what I cannot
help. It is wrong to make one's fate worse by kicking against the
pricks. You know that I am very unhappy, and you may imagine how much
more wretched I should be if I learned that you were ill, disgusted with
life, and unwilling to be comforted. But if I can find any consolation
in my affliction, it will be because I hear that you are well behaved,
and keep up your health and courage out of love for me."
This last excellent reason gave Madeleine the advantage. The waif gave
in, and promised on his knees, as if in the confessional, that he would
do his best to bear his sorrow bravely.
"Then," said he, as he wiped his eyes, "if I must go to-morrow morning,
I shall say good-by to you now, my mother Madeleine. Farewell, for this
life, perhaps; for you do not tell me if I shall ever see you and talk
with you again. If you do not think I shall ever have such happiness, do
not say so, for I should lose courage to live. Let me keep the hope of
meeting you one day here by this clear fountain, where I met you the
first time nearly eleven years ago. From that day to this, I have had
nothing but happiness; I must not forget all the joys that God has given
me through you, but shall keep them in remembrance, so that they may
help me to bear, from to-morrow onward, all that time and fate may
bring. I carry away a heart pierced and benumbed with anguish, knowing
that you are unhappy, and that in me you lose your best friend. You tell
me that your distress will be greater if I do not take heart, so I shall
sustain myself as best I may, by thoughts of you, and I value your
affection too much to forfeit it by cowardice. Farewell, Madame
Blanchet; leave me here alone a little while; I shall feel better when I
have cried my fill. If any of my tears fall into this fountain, you will
think of me whenever you come to wash here. I am going to gather some of
this mint to perfume my linen. I must soon pack my bundle; and as long
as I smell the sweet fragrance among my clothes, I shall imagine that I
am here and see you before me. Farewell, farewell, my dear mother; I
shall not go back with you to the house. I might kiss little Jeannie,
without waking him, but I have not the heart. You must kiss him for me;
and to keep him from crying, please tell him to-morrow that I am coming
back soon. So, while he is expecting me, he will have time to forget me
a little; and then later, you must talk to him of poor François, so
that he may not forget me too much. Give me your blessing, Madeleine, as
you gave it to me on the day of my first communion, for it will bring
with it the grace of God."
The poor waif knelt down before Madeleine, entreating her to forgive him
if he had ever offended her against his will.
Madeleine declared that she had nothing to forgive him, and that she
wished her blessing could prove as beneficent as that of God.
"Now," said François, "that I am again a waif, and that nobody will
ever love me any more, will not you kiss me as you once kissed me, in
kindness, on the day of my first communion? I shall need to remember
this, so that I may be very sure that you still love me in your heart,
like a mother."
Madeleine kissed the waif in the same pure spirit as when he was a
little child. Yet anybody who had seen her would have fancied there was
some justification for Monsieur Blanchet's anger, and would have blamed
this faithful woman, who had no thought of ill, and whose action could
not have displeased the Virgin Mary.
"Nor me, either," put in the priest's servant.
"And me still less," returned the hemp-dresser. Then he resumed:
She returned to the house, but not to sleep. She heard François come in
and do up his bundle in the next room, and she heard him go out again at
daybreak. She did not get up till he had gone some little distance, so
as not to weaken his courage, but when she heard his steps on the little
bridge, she opened the door a crack, without allowing herself to be
seen, so that she might catch one more last glimpse of him. She saw him
stop and look back at the river and mill, as if to bid them farewell.
Then he strode away very rapidly, after first picking a branch of poplar
and putting it in his hat, as men do when they go out for hire, to show
that they are trying to find a place.
Master Blanchet came in toward noon, but did not speak till his wife
said:
"You must go out and hire another boy for your mill, for François has
gone, and you are without a servant."
"That is quite enough, wife," answered Blanchet. "I shall go, but I warn
you not to expect another young fellow."
As these were all the thanks he gave her for her submission, her
feelings were so much wounded that she could not help showing it.
"Cadet Blanchet," said she, "I have obeyed your will; I have sent an
excellent boy away without a motive, and I must confess that I did so
with regret. I do not ask for your gratitude, but, in my turn, I have
something to command you, and that is not to insult me, for I do not
deserve it."
She said this in a manner so new to Blanchet, that it produced its
effect on him.
"Come, wife," said he, holding out his hand to her, "let us make a truce
to all this, and think no more about it. Perhaps I may have been a
little hasty in what I said; but you see I had my own reasons for not
trusting the waif. The devil is the father of all those children, and he
is always after them. They may be good in some ways, but they are sure
to be scamps in others. I know that it will be hard for me to find
another such hard worker for a servant; but the devil, who is a good
father, had whispered wantonness into that boy's ear, and I know one
woman who had a complaint against him."
"That woman is not your wife," rejoined Madeleine, "and she may be
lying. Even if she told the truth, that would be no cause for suspecting
me."
"Do I suspect you?" said Blanchet, shrugging his shoulders. "My grudge
was only against him, and now that he has gone, I have forgotten about
it. If I said anything displeasing to you, you must take it in jest."
"Such jests are not to my taste," answered Madeleine. "Keep them for
those who like them."
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XI
MADELEINE bore her sorrow very well at first. She heard from her new
servant, who had met with François, that he had been hired for eighteen
pistoles a year by a farmer, who had a good mill and some land over
toward Aigurande. She was happy to know that he had found a good place,
and did her utmost to return to her occupations, without grieving too
much. In spite of her efforts, however, she fell ill for a long time of
a low fever, and pined quietly away, without anybody's noticing it.
François was right when he said that in him she lost her best friend.
She was sad and lonely, and, having nobody to talk with, she petted all
the more her son Jeannie, who was a very nice boy, as gentle as a lamb.
But he was too young to understand all that she had to say of François,
and, besides, he showed her no such kind cares and attentions as the
waif had done at his age. Jeannie loved his mother, more even than
children ordinarily do, because she was such a mother as is hard to
find; but he never felt the same wonder and emotion about her as
François did. He thought it quite natural to be so tenderly loved and
caressed. He received it as his portion, and counted on it as his due,
whereas the waif had never been unmindful of the slightest kindness from
her, and made his gratitude so apparent in his behavior, his words and
looks, his blushes and tears, that when Madeleine was with him she
forgot that her home was bereft of peace, love, and comfort.
When she was left again forlorn, all this evil returned upon her, and
she meditated long on the sorrows which François's affectionate
companionship had kept in abeyance. Now she had nobody to read with her,
to help her in caring for the poor, to pray with her, or even now and
then to exchange a few frank, good-natured jests with her. Nothing that
she saw or did gave her any more pleasure, and her thoughts wandered
back to the time when she had with her such a kind, gentle, and loving
friend. Whether she went into her vineyard, into her orchard, or into
the mill, there was not a spot as large as a pocket-handkerchief, that
she had not passed over ten thousand times, with this child clinging to
her skirts, or this faithful, zealous friend at her side. It was as if
she had lost a son of great worth and promise; and it was in vain she
heaped her affection on the one who still remained, for half her heart
was left untenanted.
Her husband saw that she was wearing away, and felt some pity for her
languid, melancholy looks. He feared lest she might fall seriously ill,
and was loath to lose her, as she was a skilful manager, and saved on
her side as much as he wasted on his. As Sévère would not allow him to
attend to his mill, he knew that his business would go to pieces if
Madeleine no longer had the charge of it, and though he continued to
upbraid her from habit, and complained of her lack of care, he knew that
nobody else would serve him better.
He exerted himself to contrive some means of curing her of her sickness
and sorrow, and just at this juncture it happened that his uncle died.
His youngest sister had been under this uncle's guardianship, and now
she fell into his own care. He thought, at first, of sending the girl to
live with Sévère, but his other relations made him ashamed of this
project; and, besides, when Sévère found that the girl was only just
fifteen, and promised to be as fair as the day, she had no further
desire to be intrusted with such a charge, and told Blanchet that she
was afraid of the risks attendant on the care of a young girl.
So Blanchet--who saw that he should gain something by being his sister's
guardian, as the uncle, who had brought her up, had left her money in
his will; and who was unwilling to place her with any of his other
relations--brought her home to his mill, and requested his wife to treat
her as a sister and companion, to teach her to work, and let her share
in the household labors, and yet to make the task so easy that she
should have no desire to go elsewhere.
Madeleine acquiesced gladly in this family arrangement. She liked
Mariette Blanchet from the first for the sake of her beauty, the very
cause for which Sévère had disliked her. She believed, too, that a
sweet disposition and a good heart always go with a pretty face, and she
received the young girl not so much as a sister as a daughter, who might
perhaps take the place of poor François.
During all this time poor François bore his trouble with as much
patience as he had, and this was none at all; for never was man nor boy
visited with so heavy an affliction. He fell ill, in the first place,
and this was almost fortunate for him, for it proved the kindness of his
master's family, who would not allow him to be sent to the hospital, but
kept him at home, and tended him carefully. The miller, his present
master, was most unlike Cadet Blanchet, and his daughter, who was about
thirty years old, and not yet married, had a reputation for her
charities and good conduct.
These good people plainly saw, too, in spite of the waif's illness, that
they had found a treasure in him.
He was so strong and well-built that he threw off his disease more
quickly than most people, and though he set to work before he was cured,
he had no relapse. His conscience spurred him on to make up for lost
time and repay his master and mistress for their kindness. He still felt
ill for more than two months, and every morning, when he began his work,
he was as giddy as if he had just fallen from the roof of a house, but
little by little he warmed up to it, and never told the trouble it cost
him to begin. The miller and his daughter were so well pleased with him
that they intrusted him with the management of many things which were
far above his position. When they found that he could read and write,
they made him keep the accounts, which had never been kept before, and
the need of which had often involved the mill in difficulties. In short,
he was as well oft as was compatible with his misfortune; and as he had
the prudence to refrain from saying that he was a foundling, nobody
reproached him with his origin.
But neither the kind treatment he received, nor his work, nor his
illness, could make him forget Madeleine, his dear mill at Cormouer, his
little Jeannie, and the graveyard where Zabelle was lying. His heart was
always far away, and on Sundays he did nothing but brood, and so had no
rest from the labors of the week. He was at such a distance from his
home, which was more than six leagues off, that no news from it ever
reached him. He thought at first that he would become used to this, but
he was consumed with anxiety, and tried to invent means of finding out
about Madeleine, at least twice a year. He went to the fairs for the
purpose of meeting some acquaintance from the old place, and if he saw
one, he made inquiries about all his friends, beginning prudently with
those for whom he cared least, and leading up to Madeleine, who
interested him most; and thus he had some tidings of her and her family.
"But it is growing late, my friends, and I am going to sleep in the
middle of my story. I shall go on with it to-morrow, if you care to hear
it Good night, all."
The hemp-dresser went off to bed, and the farmer lit his lantern and
took Mother Monique back to the parsonage, for she was an old woman, and
could not see her way dearly.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XII
THE next evening we all met again at the farm, and the hemp-dresser
resumed his story:
François had been living about three years in the country of Aigurande,
near Villechiron, in a handsome mill which is called Haut-Champault, or
Bas-Champault, or Frechampault, for Champault is as common a name in
that country as in our own. I have been twice into those parts, and know
what a fine country it is. The peasants there are richer, and better
lodged and fed; there is more business there, and though the earth is
less fertile, it is more productive. The land is more broken; it is
pierced by rocks and washed by torrents, but it is fair and pleasant to
the eye. The trees are marvelously beautiful, and two streams, clear as
crystal, rush noisily along through their deep-cut channels.
The mills there are more considerable than ours, and the one where
François lived was among the richest and best. One winter day, his
master, by name Jean Vertaud, said to him:
"François, my servant and friend, I have something to say to you, and I
ask for your attention.
"You and I have known each other for some little time. I have done very
well in my business, and my mill has prospered; I have succeeded better
than others of my trade; in short, my fortune has increased, and I do
not conceal from myself that I owe it all to you. You have served me not
as a servant, but as a friend and relation. You have devoted yourself to
my interests as if they were your own. You have managed my property
better than I knew how to do myself, and have shown yourself possessed
of more knowledge and intelligence than I. I am not suspicious by
nature, and I should have been often cheated if you had not kept watch
of all the people and things about me. Those who were in the habit of
abusing my good nature, complained, and you bore the brunt boldly,
though more than once you exposed yourself to dangers, which you escaped
only by your courage and gentleness. What I like most about you is that
your heart is as good as your head and hand. You love order, but not
avarice. You do not allow yourself to be duped, as I do, and yet you are
as fond of helping your neighbor as I can be. You were the first to
advise me to be generous in real cases of need, but you were quick to
hold me back from giving to those who were merely making a pretense of
distress. You have sense and originality. The ideas you put into
practice are always successful, and whatever you touch turns to good
account.
"I am well pleased with you, and I should like, on my part, to do
something for you. Tell me frankly what you want, for I shall refuse you
nothing."
"I do not know why you say this," answered François. "You must think,
Master Vertaud, that I am dissatisfied with you, but it is not so. You
may be sure of that."
"I do not say that you are dissatisfied, but you do not generally look
like a happy man. Your spirits are not good. You never laugh and jest,
nor take any amusement. You are as sober as if you were in mourning for
somebody."
"Do you blame me for this, master? I shall never be able to please you
in this respect, for I am fond neither of the bottle nor of the dance; I
go neither to the tavern nor to balls; I know no funny stories nor
nonsense. I care for nothing which might distract me from my duty."
"You deserve to be held in high esteem for this, my boy, and I am not
going to blame you for it. I mention it, because I believe that there is
something on your mind. Perhaps you think that you are taking a great
deal of trouble on behalf of other people, and are but poorly paid for
it."
"You are wrong in thinking so, Master Vertaud. My reward is as great as
I could wish, and perhaps I could never have found elsewhere the high
wages which you are willing to allow me, of your own free will, and
without any urging from me. You have increased them, too, every year,
and, on Saint John's day last, you fixed them at a hundred crowns, which
is a very large price for you to pay. If you suffer any inconvenience
from it, I assure you that I should gladly relinquish it."
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XIII
"COME, come, François, we do not understand each other," returned
Master Jean Vertaud; "and I do not know how to take you. You are no
fool, and I think my hints have been broad enough; but you are so shy
that I will help you out still further. Are not you in love with some
girl about here?"
"No, master," was the waif's honest answer.
"Truly?"
"I give you my word."
"Don't you know one who might please you, if you were able to pay your
court to her?"
"I have no desire to marry."
"What an idea! You are too young to answer for that. What's your
reason?"
"My reason? Do you really care to know, master?"
"Yes, because I feel an interest in you."
"Then I will tell you; there is no occasion for me to hide it: I have
never known father or mother. And there is something I have never told
you; I was not obliged to do so; but if you had asked me, I should have
told you the truth: I am a waif; I come from the foundling asylum."
"Is it possible?" exclaimed Jean Vertaud, somewhat taken aback by this
confession. "I should never have thought it."
"Why should you never have thought it? You do not answer, Master
Vertaud. Very well, I shall answer for you. You saw that I was a good
fellow, and you could not believe that a waif could be like that. It is
true, then, that nobody has confidence in waifs, and that there is a
prejudice against them. It is not just or humane; but since such a
prejudice exists, everybody must conform to it, and the best people are
not exempt, since you yourself--"
"No, no," said Master Vertaud, with a revulsion of feeling, for he was a
just man, and always ready to abjure a false notion; "I do not wish to
fail in justice, and if I forgot myself for a moment, you must forgive
me, for that is all past now. So, you think you cannot marry, because
you were born a waif?"
"Not at all, master; I do not consider that an obstacle. There are all
sorts of women, and some of them are so kind-hearted that my misfortune
might prove an inducement."
"That is true," cried Jean Vertaud. "Women are better than we are. Yet,"
he continued, with a laugh, "a fine handsome fellow like you, in the
flower of youth, and without any defect of body or mind, might very well
add a zest to the pleasure of being charitable. But come, give me your
reason."
"Listen," said François. "I was taken from the asylum and nursed by a
woman whom I never knew. At her death I was intrusted to another woman,
who received me for the sake of the slender pittance granted by the
government to those of my kind; but she was good to me, and when I was
so unfortunate as to lose her, I should never have been comforted but
for the help of another woman, who was the best of the three, and whom I
still love so much, that I am unwilling to live for any other woman but
her. I have left her, and perhaps I may never see her again, for she is
well off, and may never have need of me. Still, her husband has had many
secret expenses, and I have heard that he has been ill since autumn, so
it may be that he will die before long, and leave her with more debts
than property. If this happened, master, I do not deny that I should
return to the place she lives in, and that my only care and desire would
be to assist her and her son, and keep them from poverty by my toil.
That is my reason for not undertaking any engagement which would bind me
elsewhere. You employ me by the year, but if I married, I should be tied
for life. I should be assuming too many duties at once. If I had a wife
and children, it is not to be supposed that I could earn enough bread
for two families; neither is it to be supposed, if, by extraordinary
luck, I found a wife with some money of her own, that I should have the
right to deprive my house of its comforts, to bestow them upon
another's. Thus I expect to remain a bachelor. I am young, and have time
enough before me; but if some fancy for a girl should enter my head, I
should try to get rid of it; because, do you see, there is but one woman
in the world for me, and that is my mother Madeleine, who never despised
me for being a waif, but brought me up as her own child."
"Is that it?" answered Jean Vertaud. "My dear fellow, what you tell me
only increases my esteem for you. Nothing is so ugly as ingratitude, and
nothing so beautiful as the memory of benefits received. I may have some
good reasons for showing you that you could many a young woman of the
same mind as yourself, who would join you in aiding your old friend, but
they are reasons which I must think over, and I must ask somebody else's
opinion."
No great cleverness was necessary to guess that Jean Vertaud, with his
honest heart and sound judgment, had conceived of a marriage between his
daughter and François. His daughter was comely, and though she was
somewhat older than François, she had money enough to make up the
difference. She was an only child, and a fine match, but up to this
time, to her father's great vexation, she had refused to marry. He had
observed lately that she thought a great deal of François, and had
questioned her about him, but as she was a very reserved person, he had
some difficulty in extorting any confession from her. Finally, without
giving a positive answer, she consented to allow her father to sound
François on the subject of marriage, and awaited the result with more
uneasiness than she cared to show.
Jean Vertaud was disappointed that he had not a more satisfactory answer
to carry to her; first, because he was so anxious to have her married,
and next, because he could not wish for a better son-in-law than
François. Besides the affection he felt for him, he saw clearly that
the poor boy who had come to him was worth his weight in gold, on
account of his intelligence, his quickness at his work, and his good
conduct.
The young woman was a little pained to hear that François was a
foundling. She was a trifle proud, but she made up her mind quickly, and
her liking became more pronounced when she learned that François was
backward in love. Women go by contraries, and if François had schemed
to obtain indulgence for the irregularity of his birth, he could have
contrived no more artful device that that of showing a distaste toward
marriage.
So it happened that Jean Vertaud's daughter decided in François's
favor, that day, for the first time.
"Is that all?" said she to her father. "Doesn't he think that we should
have both the desire and the means to aid an old woman and find a
situation for her son? He cannot have understood your hints, father, for
if he knew it was a question of entering our family, he would have felt
no such anxiety."
That evening, when they were at work, Jeannette Vertaud said to
François:
"I have always had a high opinion of you, François; but it is still
higher now that my father has told me of your affection for the woman
who brought you up, and for whom you wish to work all your life. It is
right for you to feel so. I should like to know the woman, so that I
might serve her in case of need, because you have always been so fond of
her. She must be a fine woman."
"Oh! yes," said François, who was pleased to talk of Madeleine, "she is
a woman with a good heart, a woman with a heart like yours."
Jeannette Vertaud was delighted at this, and, thinking herself sure of
what she wanted, went on:
"If she should turn out as unfortunate as you fear, I wish she could
come and live with us. I should help you take care of her, for I suppose
that she is no longer young. Is not she infirm?"
"Infirm? No," said François; "she is not old enough to be infirm."
"Then is she still young?" asked Jeannette Vertaud, beginning to prick
up her ears.
"Oh! no, she is not young," answered François, simply. "I do not
remember how old she is now. She was a mother to me, and I never thought
of her age."
"Was she attractive?" asked Jeannette, after hesitating a moment before
putting the question.
"Attractive?" said François, with some surprise; "do you mean to ask if
she is a pretty woman? She is pretty enough for me just as she is; but
to tell the truth, I never thought of that. What difference can it make
in my affection for her? She might be as ugly as the devil, without my
finding it out."
"But cannot you tell me about how old she is?"
"Wait a minute. Her son was five years younger than I. Well! She is not
old, but she is not very young; she is about like--"
"Like me?" said Jeannette, making a slight effort to laugh. "In that
case, if she becomes a widow, it will be too late for her to marry
again, will it not?"
"That depends on circumstances," replied François. "If her husband has
not wasted all the property, she would have plenty of suitors. There are
fellows, who would marry their great-aunts as wittingly as their
great-nieces, for money."
"Then you have no esteem for those who marry for money?"
"I could not do it," answered François.
Simple-hearted as the waif was, he was no such simpleton as not to
understand the insinuations which had been made him, and he did not
speak without meaning. But Jeannette would not take the hint, and fell
still deeper in love with him. She had had many admirers, without paying
attention to any of them, and now the only one who pleased her, turned
his back on her. Such is the logical temper of a woman's mind.
François observed during the following days that she had something on
her mind, for she ate scarcely anything, and her eyes were always fixed
on him, whenever she thought he was not looking. Her attachment pained
him. He respected this good woman, and saw that the more indifferent he
appeared, the more she cared about him; but he had no fancy for her, and
if he had tried to cultivate such a feeling, it would have been the
result of duty and principle rather than of spontaneous affection.
He reflected that he could not stay much longer with Jean Vertaud,
because he knew that, sooner or later, such a condition of affairs must
necessarily give rise to some unfortunate difference.
Just at this time, however, an incident befell which changed the current
of his thoughts.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XIV
ONE morning the parish priest of Aigurande came strolling over to Jean
Vertaud's mill, and wandered round the place for some time before
espying François, whom he found at last in a corner of the garden. He
assumed a very confidential air, and asked him if he were indeed
François, surnamed Strawberry, a name that had been given him in the
civil register--where he had been inscribed as a foundling--on account
of a certain mark on his left arm. The priest then inquired concerning
his exact age, the name of the woman who had nursed him, the places in
which he had lived; in short, all that he knew of his birth and life.
François produced his papers, and the priest seemed to be entirely
satisfied.
"Very well," said he, "you may come this evening or to-morrow morning to
the parsonage; but you must not let anybody know what I am going to tell
you, for I am forbidden to make it public, and it is a matter of
conscience with me."
When François went to the parsonage, the priest carefully shut the
doors of the room, and drawing four little bits of thin paper from his
desk, said:
"François Strawberry, there are four thousand francs that your mother
sends you. I am forbidden to tell you her name, where she lives, or
whether she is alive or dead at the present moment. A pious thought has
induced her to remember you, and it appears that she always intended to
do so, since she knew where you were to be found, although you lived at
such a distance. She knew that your character was good, and gives you
enough to establish yourself with in life, on condition that for six
months you never mention this gift, unless it be to the woman you want
to marry. She enjoins me to consult with you on the investment or the
safe deposit of this money, and begs me to lend my name, in case it is
necessary, in order to keep the affair secret. I shall do as you like in
this respect; but I am ordered to deliver you the money, only in
exchange for your word of honor that you will neither say nor do
anything that might divulge the secret. I know that I may count upon
your good faith; will you pledge it to me?"
François gave his oath and left the money in the priest's charge,
begging him to lay it out to the best advantage, for he knew this priest
to be a good man; and some priests are like some women, either all good
or all bad.
The waif returned home rather sad than glad. He thought of his mother,
and would have been glad to give up the four thousand francs for the
privilege of seeing and embracing her. He imagined, too, that perhaps
she had just died, and that her gift was the result of one of those
impulses which come to people at the point of death; and it made him
still more melancholy to be unable to bear mourning for her and have
masses said for her soul. Whether she were dead or alive, he prayed God
to forgive her for forsaking her child, as her child forgave her with
his whole heart, and prayed to be forgiven his sins in like manner.
He tried to appear the same as usual; but for more than a fortnight, he
was so absorbed in a reverie at meal-times that the attention of the
Vertauds was excited.
"That young man does not confide in us," observed the miller. "He must
be in love."
"Perhaps it is with me," thought the daughter, "and he is too modest to
confess it. He is afraid that I shall think him more attracted by my
money than my person, so he is trying to prevent our guessing what is on
his mind."
Thereupon, she set to work to cure him of his shyness, and encouraged
him so frankly and sweetly in her words and looks, that he was a little
touched in spite of his preoccupation.
Occasionally, he said to himself that he was rich enough to help
Madeleine in case of need, and that he could well afford to marry a girl
who laid no claim to his fortune. He was not in love with any woman, but
he saw Jeannette Vertaud's good qualities, and was afraid of being
hard-hearted if he did not respond to her advances. At times he pitied
her, and was almost ready to console her.
But all at once, on a journey which he made to Crevant on his master's
business, he met a forester from Presles, who told him of Cadet
Blanchet's death, adding that he had left his affairs in great disorder,
and that nobody knew whether his widow would be able to right them.
François had no cause to love or regret Master Blanchet, yet his heart
was so tender that when he heard the news his eyes were moist and his
head heavy, as if he were about to weep; he knew that Madeleine was
weeping for her husband at that very moment, that she forgave him
everything, and remembered only that he was the father of her child. The
thought of Madeleine's grief awoke his own, and obliged him to weep with
her over the sorrow which he was sure was hers.
His first impulse was to leap upon his horse and hasten to her side; but
he reflected that it was his duty to ask permission of his master.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XV
"MASTER," said he to Jean Vertaud, "I must leave you for a time; how
long I cannot tell. I have something to attend to near my old home, and
I request you to let me go with a good will; for, to tell the truth, if
you refuse to give your permission, I shall not be able to obey you, but
shall go in spite of you. Forgive me for stating the case plainly. I
should be very sorry to vex you, and that is why I ask you as a reward
for all the services that I may have been able to render you, not to
take my behavior amiss, but to forgive the offense of which I am guilty,
in leaving your work so suddenly. I may return at the end of a week, if
I am not needed in the place where I am going; but I may not come back
till late in the year, or not at all, for I am unwilling to deceive you.
However, I shall do my best to come to your assistance if you need me,
or if anything were to occur which you cannot manage without me. Before
I go, I shall find you a good workman to take my place, and, if
necessary, offer him as an inducement all that is due on my wages since
Saint John's day last. Thus I can arrange matters without loss to you,
and you must shake hands to wish me good luck, and to ease my mind of
some of the regret I feel at parting with you."
Jean Vertaud knew that the waif seldom asked for anything, but that when
he did, his will was so firm that neither God nor the devil could bend
it.
"Do as you please, my boy," said he, shaking hands with him. "I should
not tell the truth if I said I did not care; but rather than have a
quarrel with you, I should consent to anything."
François spent the next day in looking up a servant to take his place
in the mill, and he met with a zealous, upright man who was returning
from the army, and was happy to find work and good wages under a good
master; for Jean Vertaud was recognized as such, and was known never to
have wronged anybody.
Before setting out, as he intended to do at daybreak the next day,
François wished to take leave of Jeannette Vertaud at supper-time. She
was sitting at the barn door, saying that her head ached and that she
could not eat. He observed that she had been weeping, and felt much
troubled in mind. He did not know how to thank her for her kindness, and
yet tell her that he was to leave her in spite of it. He sat down beside
her on the stump of an alder-tree, which happened to be there, and
struggled to speak, without being able to think of a single word to say.
She saw all this, without looking up, and pressed her handkerchief to
her eyes. He made a motion to take her hand in his and comfort her, but
drew back as it occurred to him that he could not conscientiously tell
her what she wanted to hear. When poor Jeannette found that he remained
silent, she was ashamed of her own sorrow, and rising quietly without
showing any bitterness of feeling, she went into the barn to weep
unrestrained.
She lingered there a little while, in the hope that he would make up his
mind to follow her and say a kind word, but he forbore, and went to his
supper, which he ate in melancholy silence.
It would be false to say that he had felt nothing for Jeannette when he
saw her in tears. His heart was a little fluttered, as he reflected how
happy he might be with a person of so excellent a disposition, who was
so fond of him, and who was not personally disagreeable to him. But he
shook off all these ideas when it returned to his mind that Madeleine
might stand in need of a friend, adviser, and servant, and that when he
was but a poor, forsaken child, wasted with fever, she had endured,
worked, and braved more for him than anybody else in the world.
"Come," said he to himself, when he woke next morning before the dawn;
"you must not think of a love-affair or your own happiness and
tranquillity. You would gladly forget that you are a waif, and would
throw your past to the winds, as so many others do, who seize the moment
as it flies, without looking behind them. Yes, but think of Madeleine
Blanchet, who entreats you not to forget her, but to remember what she
did for you. Forward, then; and Jeannette, may God help you to a more
gallant lover than your humble servant."
Such were his reflections as he passed beneath the window of his kind
mistress, and if the season had been propitious, he would have left a
leaf or flower against her casement, in token of farewell; but it was
the day after the feast of the Epiphany; the ground was covered with
snow, and there was not a leaf on the trees nor a violet in the grass.
He thought of knotting into the corner of a white handkerchief the bean
which he had won the evening before in the Twelfth-night cake, and of
tying the handkerchief to the bars of Jeannette's window, to show her
that he would have chosen her for his queen, if she had deigned to
appear at supper.
"A bean is a very little thing," thought he, "but it is a slight mark of
courtesy and friendship, and will make my excuses for not having said
good-by to her."
But a still, small voice within counseled him against making this
offering, and pointed out to him that a man should not follow the
example of those young girls who try to make men love, remember, and
regret them, when they have not the slightest idea of giving anything in
return.
"No, no, François," said he, putting back his pledge into his pocket,
and hastening his step; "a man's will must be firm, and he must allow
himself to be forgotten when he has made up his mind to forget himself."
Thereupon, he strode rapidly away, and before he had gone two gunshots
from Jean Vertaud's mill he fancied that he saw Madeleine's image before
him, and heard a faint little voice calling to him for help. This dream
drew him on, and he seemed to see already the great ash-tree, the
fountain, the meadow of the Blanchets, the mill-dam, the little bridge,
and Jeannie running to meet him; and in the midst of all this, the
memory of Jeannette Vertaud was powerless to hold him back an inch.
He walked so fast that he felt neither cold nor hunger nor thirst, nor
did he stop to take breath till he left the highroad and reached the
cross of Plessys, which stands at the beginning of the path which leads
to Presles.
When there, he flung himself on his knees and kissed the wood of the
cross with the ardor of a good Christian who meets again with a good
friend. Then he began to descend the great track, which is like a road,
except that it is as broad as a field. It is the finest common in the
world, and is blessed with a beautiful view, fresh air, and extended
horizon. It slopes so rapidly that in frosty weather a man could go
post-haste even in an ox-cart and take an unexpected plunge in the
river, which runs silently below.
François mistrusted this; he took off his sabots more than once, and
reached the bridge without a tumble. He passed by Montipouret on the
left, not without sending a loving salute to the tall old clock-tower,
which is everybody's friend; for it is the first to greet the eyes of
those who are returning home, and shows them the right road, if they
have gone astray.
As to the roads, I have no fault to find with them in summer-time, when
they are green, smiling, and pleasant to look upon. You may walk through
some of them with no fear of a sunstroke; but those are the most
treacherous of all, because they may lead you to Rome, when you think
you are going to Angibault. Happily, the good clock-tower of Montipouret
is not chary of showing itself, and through every dealing you may catch
a glimpse of its glittering steeple, that tells you whether you are
going north or northwest.
The waif, however, needed no such beacon to guide him. He was so
familiar with all the wooded paths and byways, all the shady lanes, all
the hunters' trails, and even the very hedge-rows along the roads, that
in the middle of the night he could take the shortest cut, and go as
straight as a pigeon flies through the sky.
It was toward noon when he first caught sight of the mill of Cormouer
through the leafless branches, and he was happy to see curling up from
the roof a faint blue smoke, which assured him that the house was not
abandoned to the rats.
For greater speed he crossed the upper part of the Blanchet meadow, and
thus did not pass close by the fountain; but as the trees and bushes
were stript of their leaves, he could still see sparkling in the
sunlight the open water, that never freezes, because it bubbles up from
a spring. The approach to the mill, on the contrary, was icy and so
slippery that much caution was required to step safely over the stones,
and along the bank of the river. He saw the old mill-wheel, black with
age and damp, covered with long icicles, sharp as needles, that hung
from the bars.
Many trees were missing around the house, and the place was much
changed. Cadet Blanchet's debts had called the ax into play, and here
and there were to be seen the stumps of great alders, freshly cut, as
red as blood. The house seemed to be in bad repair; the roof was
ill-protected, and the oven had cracked half open by the action of the
frost.
What was still more melancholy was that there was no sound to be heard
of man or beast; only a brindled black-and-white dog, a poor country
mongrel, jumped up from the door-step and ran barking toward François;
then he suddenly ceased, and came crawling up to him and lay at his
feet.
"Is it you, Labriche, and do you know me?" said François. "I did not
recognize you, for you are so old and miserable; your ribs stick out,
and your whiskers are quite white."
François talked thus to the dog, because he was distressed, and wanted
to gain a little time before entering the house. He had been in great
haste up to this moment, but now he was alarmed, because he feared that
he should never see Madeleine again, that she might be absent or dead
instead of her husband, or that the report of the miller's death might
prove false; in short, he was a prey to all those fancies which beset
the mind of a man who has just reached the goal of all his desires.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVI
FINALLY François drew the latch of the door, and beheld, instead of
Madeleine, a lovely young girl, rosy as a May morning, and lively as a
linnet. She said to him, with an engaging manner: "What is it you want,
young man?"
Though she was so fair to see, François did not waste time in looking
at her, but cast his eyes round the room in search of Madeleine. He saw
nothing but the closed curtains of her bed, and he was sure that she was
in it. He did not wait to answer the pretty girl, who was Mariette
Blanchet, the miller's youngest sister, but without a word walked up to
the yellow bed and pulled the curtains noiselessly aside; there he saw
Madeleine Blanchet lying asleep, pale and wasted with fever.
He looked at her long and fixedly, without moving or speaking; and in
spite of his grief at her illness, and his fear of her dying, he was yet
happy to have her face before him, and to be able to say: "I see
Madeleine."
Mariette Blanchet pushed him gently away from the bed, drew the curtains
together, and beckoned to him to follow her to the fireside.
"Now, young man," said she, "who are you, and what do you want? I do not
know you, and you are a stranger in the neighborhood. Tell me how I may
oblige you."
François did not listen to her, and instead of answering her, he began
to ask questions about how long Madame Blanchet had been ill, whether
she were in any danger, and whether she were well cared for.
Mariette answered that Madeleine had been ill since her husband's death,
because she had overexerted herself in nursing him, and watching at his
bedside, day and night; that they had not as yet sent for the doctor,
but that they would do so in case she was worse; and as to her being
well cared for, Mariette declared that she knew her duty and did not
spare herself.
At these words, the waif looked the girl full in the face, and had no
need to ask her name, for besides knowing that soon after he had left
the mill, Master Blanchet had placed his sister in his wife's charge, he
detected in the pretty face of this pretty girl a striking resemblance
to the sinister face of the dead miller. There are many fine and
delicate faces which have an inexplicable likeness to ugly ones; and
though Mariette Blanchet's appearance was as charming as that of her
brother had been disagreeable, she still had an unmistakable family
look. Only the miller's expression had been surly and irascible, while
Mariette's was mocking rather than resentful, and fearless instead of
threatening.
So it was that François was neither altogether disturbed nor altogether
at ease concerning the attention Madeleine might receive from this young
girl. Her cap was of fine linen, neatly folded and pinned; her hair,
which she wore somewhat after the fashion of town-bred girls, was very
lustrous, and carefully combed and parted; and both her hands and her
apron were very white for a sick-nurse. In short, she was much too
young, fresh, and gay to spend the day and night in helping a person who
was unable to help herself.
François asked no more questions, but sat down in the chimney-corner,
determined not to leave the place until he saw whether his dear
Madeleine's illness turned for the better or worse.
Mariette was astonished to see him take possession of the fire so
cavalierly, just as if he were in his own house. He stared into the
blaze, and as he seemed in no humor for talking, she dared inquire no
further who he was and what was his business. After a moment, Catherine,
who had been the house-servant for eighteen or twenty years, came into
the room. She paid no attention to him, but approached the bed of her
mistress, looked at her cautiously, and then turned to the fireplace, to
see after the potion which Mariette was concocting. Her behavior showed
an intense interest for Madeleine, and François, who took the truth of
the matter in a throb, was on the point of addressing her with a
friendly greeting; but--
"But," said the priest's servant, interrupting the hemp-dresser, "you
are using an unsuitable word. A _throb_ does not express a moment, or a
minute."
"I tell you," retorted the hemp-dresser, "that a moment means nothing at
all, and a minute is longer than it takes for an idea to rush into the
head. I do not know how many millions of things you can think of in a
minute, whereas you only need a throb of time to see and hear some one
thing that is happening. I will say a little throb, if you please."
"But a throb of time!" objected the old purist.
"Ah! A throb of time! Does that worry you, Mother Monique? Does not
everything go by throbs? Does not the sun, when you see it rising in the
clouds of flames, and it makes your eyes blink to look at it? And the
blood that beats in your veins; the church clock that sifts your time
particle by particle, as a bolting-machine does the grain; your rosary
when you tell it; your heart when the priest is delayed in coming home;
the rain falling drop by drop, and the earth that turns round, as they
say, like a mill-wheel? Neither you nor I feel the motion, the machine
is too well oiled for that; but there must be some throbbing about it,
since it accomplishes its period in twenty-four hours. As to that, too,
we use the word _period_ when we speak of a certain length of time. So I
say a _throb_, and I shall not unsay it. Do not interrupt me any more,
unless you wish to tell the story."
"No, no; your machine is too well oiled, too," answered the old woman.
"Now let your tongue throb a little longer."
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVII
I WAS saying that François was tempted to speak to big old Catherine,
and make himself known to her; but as in the same throb of time he was
on the point of crying, he did not wish to behave like a fool, and did
not even raise his head. As Catherine stooped over the ashes, she caught
sight of his long legs and drew back in alarm.
"What is all that?" whispered she to Mariette in the other corner of the
room. "Where does that man come from?"
"Do you ask me?" said the girl; "how should I know? I never saw him
before. He came in here, as if he were at an inn, without a good-morning
or good-evening. He asked after the health of my sister-in-law as if he
were a near relation, or her heir; and there he is sitting by the fire,
as you see. You may speak to him, for I do not care to do so. He may be
a disreputable person."
"What? Do you think he is crazy? He does not look wicked, as far as I
can see, for he seems to be hiding his face."
"Suppose he has come for some bad purpose?"
"Do not be afraid, Mariette, for I am near to keep him in check. If he
alarms you, I shall pour a kettle of boiling water over his legs, and
throw an andiron at his head."
While they were chattering thus, François was thinking of Madeleine.
"That poor dear woman," said he to himself, "who has never had anything
but vexation and unkindness from her husband, is now lying ill because
she nursed and helped him to the end. Here is this young girl, who was
the miller's pet sister, as I have heard say, and her face bears no
traces of sorrow. She shows no signs of fatigue or tears, for her eyes
are as dear and bright as the sun."
He could not help looking at her from under the brim of his hat, for
never until then had he seen such fresh and joyous beauty. Still, though
his eyes were charmed, his heart remained untouched.
"Come," continued Catherine, in a whisper to her young mistress, "I am
going to speak to him. I must find out his business here."
"Speak to him politely," said Mariette. "We must not irritate him; we
are all alone in the house, and Jeannie may be too far away to hear our
cries."
"Jeannie!" exclaimed François, who caught nothing from all their
prattle, except the name of his old friend. "Where is Jeannie, and why
don't I see him? Has he grown tall, strong, and handsome?"
"There," thought Catherine, "he asks this because he has some evil
intention. Who is the man, for Heaven's sake? I know neither his voice
nor his figure; I must satisfy myself and look at his face."
She was strong as a laborer and bold as a soldier, and would not have
quailed before the devil himself, so she stalked up to François,
determined either to make him take off his hat, or to knock it off
herself, so that she might see whether he were a monster or a Christian
man. She approached the waif, without suspecting that it was he; for
being as little given to thinking of the past as of the future, she had
long forgotten all about François, and, moreover, he had improved so
much and was now such a handsome fellow that she might well have looked
at him several times before recalling him to mind; but just as she was
about to accost him rather roughly, Madeleine awoke, and called
Catherine, saying in a faint, almost inaudible voice that she was
burning with thirst.
François sprang up, and would have been the first to reach her but for
the fear of exciting her too much, which held him back. He quickly
handed the draught to Catherine, who hastened with it to her mistress,
forgetting everything for the moment but the sick woman's condition.
Mariette, too, did her share, by raising Madeleine in her arms, to help
her drink, and this was no hard task, for Madeleine was so thin and
wasted that it was heartbreaking to see her.
"How do you feel, sister?" asked Mariette.
"Very well, my child," answered Madeleine in the tone of one about to
die. She never complained, to avoid distressing the others.
"That is not Jeannie over there," she said, as she caught sight of the
waif. "Am I dreaming, my child, or who is that tall man standing by the
fire?"
Catherine answered:
"We do not know, dear mistress; he says nothing, and behaves like an
idiot."
The waif, at this moment, made a little motion to go toward Madeleine,
but restrained himself, for though he was dying to speak to her, he was
afraid of taking her by surprise. Catherine now saw his face, but he had
changed so much in the past three years that she did not recognize him,
and thinking that Madeleine was frightened, she said:
"Do not worry, dear mistress; I was just going to turn him out, when you
called me."
"Don't turn him out," said Madeleine, in a stronger voice, pulling aside
the curtain of her bed; "I know him, and he has done right in coming to
see me. Come nearer, my son; I have been praying God every day to permit
me the grace of giving you my blessing."
The waif ran to her, and threw himself on his knees beside her bed,
shedding tears of joy and sorrow that nearly suffocated him. Madeleine
touched his hands, and then his head; and said, as she kissed him:
"Call Jeannie; Catherine, call Jeannie, that he may share this happiness
with us. Ah! I thank God, François, and I am ready to die now, if such
is his will, for both my children are grown, and I may bid them farewell
in peace."
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XVIII
CATHERINE rushed off in pursuit of Jeannie, and Mariette was so anxious
to know what it all meant, that she followed to ask questions. François
was left alone with Madeleine, who kissed him again, and burst into
tears; then she closed her eyes, looking still more weak and exhausted
than she had been before. François saw that she had fainted, and knew
not how to revive her; he was beside himself, and could only hold her in
his arms, calling her his dear mother, his dearest friend, and imploring
her, as if it lay within her power, not to die so soon, without hearing
what he had to say.
So, by his tender words, devoted care, and fond endearments, he restored
her to consciousness, and she began again to see and hear him. He told
her that he had guessed she needed him, that he had left all, and had
come to stay as long as she wanted him, and that, if she would take him
for her servant, he would ask nothing but the pleasure of working for
her, and the solace of spending his life in her service.
"Do not answer," he continued; "do not speak, my dear mother; you are
too weak, and must not say a word. Only look at me, if you are pleased
to see me again, and I shall understand that you accept my friendship
and help."
Madeleine looked at him so serenely, and was so much comforted by what
he said, that they were contented and happy together, notwithstanding
the misfortune of her illness.
Jeannie, who came in answer to Catherine's loud cries, arrived to take
his share of their joy. He had grown into a handsome boy between
fourteen and fifteen, and though not strong, he was delightfully active,
and so well brought up that he was always friendly and polite.
"Oh! How glad I am to see you like this, Jeannie," said François. "You
are not very tall and strong, but I am satisfied, because I think you
will need my help in climbing trees and crossing the river. I see that
you are delicate, though you are not ill, isn't it so? Well, you shall
be my child, still a little while longer, if you do not mind. Yes, yes;
you will find me necessary to you; and you will make me carry out your
wishes, just as it was long ago."
"Yes," said Jeannie; "my four hundred wishes, as you used to call them."
"Oho! What a good memory you have! How nice it was of you, Jeannie, not
to forget François! But have we still four hundred wishes a day?"
"Oh, no," said Madeleine; "he has grown very reasonable; he has no more
than two hundred now."
"No more nor less?" asked François.
"Just as you like," answered Jeannie; "since my darling mother is
beginning to smile again, I am ready to agree to anything. I am even
willing to say that I wish more than five hundred times a day to see her
well again."
"That is right, Jeannie," said François. "See how nicely he talks! Yes,
my boy, God will grant those five hundred wishes of yours. We shall take
such good care of your darling mother, and shall cheer and gladden her
little by little, until she forgets her weariness."
Catherine stood at the threshold, and was most anxious to come in, to
see and speak to François, but Mariette held her by the sleeve, and
would not leave off asking questions.
"What," said she, "is he a foundling? He looks so respectable."
She was looking through the crack in the door, which she held ajar.
"How comes it that he and Madeleine are such friends?"
"I tell you that she brought him up, and that he was always a very good
boy."
"She has never spoken of him to me, nor have you."
"Oh, goodness, no! I never thought of it; he was away; and I almost
forgot him; then, I knew, too, that my mistress had been in trouble on
his account, and I did not wish to recall it to her mind."
"Trouble! What kind of trouble?"
"Oh! because she was so fond of him; she could not help liking him, he
had such a good heart, poor child. Your brother would not allow him in
the house, and you know your brother was not always very gentle!"
"We must not say that, now that he is dead, Catherine."
"Yes, yes; you are right; I was not thinking. Dear me, how short my
memory is! And yet it is only two weeks since he died! But let me go in,
my young lady; I want to give the boy some dinner, for I think he must
be hungry."
She shook herself loose, ran up to François, and kissed him. He was so
handsome that she no longer remembered having once said that she would
rather kiss her sabot than a foundling.
"Oh, poor François," said she, "how glad I am to see you! I was afraid
that you would never come back. See, my dear mistress, how changed he
is! I wonder that you were able to recognize him at once. If you had not
told me who he was, I should not have known him for ages. How handsome
he is, isn't he? His beard is beginning to grow; yes, you cannot see it
much, but you can feel it. It did not prick when you went away,
François, but now it pricks a little. And how strong you are, my
friend! What hands and arms and legs you have! A workman like you is
worth three. What wages are you getting now?"
Madeleine laughed softly to see Catherine so pleased with François, and
was overjoyed that he was so strong and vigorous. She wished that her
Jeannie might grow up to be like him. Mariette was ashamed to have
Catherine look so boldly in a man's face, and blushed involuntarily. But
the more she tried not to look at him, the more her eyes strayed toward
him; she saw that Catherine was right; he was certainly remarkably
handsome, tall and erect as a young oak.
Then, without stopping to think, she began to serve him very politely,
pouring out the best wine of that year's vintage, and recalling his
attention when it wandered to Madeleine and Jeannie, and he forgot to
eat.
"You must eat more," said she; "you scarcely take anything. You should
have more appetite after so long a journey."
"Pay no attention to me, young lady," answered François, at last; "I am
too happy to be here to care about eating and drinking. Come now,"
continued he, turning to Catherine, when the room was put to rights,
"show me round the mill and the house, for everything looks neglected,
and I want to talk to you about it."
When they were outside, he questioned her intelligently on the state of
things, with the air of a man determined to know the whole truth.
"Oh, François," said Catherine, bursting into tears, "everything is
going to grief, and if nobody comes to the assistance of my poor
mistress, I believe that wicked woman will turn her out of doors, and
make her spend all she owns in lawsuits."
"Do not cry," said François, "for if you do, I cannot understand what
you say; try to speak more clearly. What wicked woman do you mean? Is it
Sévère?"
"Oh! yes, to be sure. She is not content with having ruined our master,
but now lays claim to everything he left. She is trying to prosecute us
in fifty different ways; she says that Cadet Blanchet gave her
promissory notes, and that even if she sold everything over our heads,
she would not be paid. She sends us bailiffs every day, and the expenses
are already considerable. Our mistress has paid all she could, in trying
to pacify her, and I am very much afraid that she will die of this
worry, on top of all the fatigue she underwent during her husband's
illness. At this rate, we shall soon be without food and fire. The
servant of the mill has left us, because he was owed two years' wages,
and could not be paid. The mill has stopped running, and if this goes
on, we shall lose our customers. The horses and crops have been
attached, and are to be sold; the trees are to be cut down. Oh,
François, it is ruin!"
Her tears began to flow afresh.
"And how about you, Catherine?" asked François; "are you a creditor,
too? Have your wages been paid?"
"I, a creditor?" said Catherine, changing her wail into a roar; "never,
never! It is nobody's business whether my wages are paid or not!"
"Good for you, Catherine; you show the right spirit!" said François.
"Keep on taking care of your mistress, and do not bother about the rest
I have earned a little money in my last place, and I have enough with me
to save the horses, the crops, and the trees. I am going to pay a little
visit to the mill, and if I find it in disorder, I shall not need a
wheelwright to set it going again. Jeannie is as swift as a little bird,
and he must set out immediately and run all day, and then begin again
to-morrow morning, so as to let all the customers know that the mill is
creaking like ten thousand devils, and that the miller is waiting to
grind the corn."
"Shall we send for a doctor for our mistress?"
"I have been thinking about it; but I am going to wait and watch her all
day, before making up my mind.
"Do you see, Catherine, I believe that doctors are useful when the sick
cannot do without them; but if the disease is not violent, it is easier
to recover with God's help, than with their drugs: not taking into
consideration that the mere presence of a doctor, which cures the rich,
often kills the poor. He cheers and amuses those who live in luxury, but
he scares and oppresses those who never see him except in the day of
danger. It seems to me that Madame Blanchet will recover very soon, if
her affairs are straightened.
"And before we finish this conversation, Catherine, tell me one thing
more; I ask the truth of you, and you must not scruple to tell it to me.
It will go no further; I have not changed, and if you remember me, you
must know that a secret is safe in the waif's bosom."
"Yes, yes, I know," said Catherine; "but why do you consider yourself a
waif? Nobody will call you any more by that name, for you do not deserve
it, François."
"Never mind that. I shall always be what I am, and I am not in the habit
of plaguing myself about it. Tell me what you think of your young
mistress, Mariette Blanchet."
"Oh, she! She is a pretty girl. Have you already taken it into your head
to marry her? She has some money of her own; her brother could not touch
her property, because she was a minor, and unless you have fallen heir
to an estate, Master François--"
"Waifs never inherit anything," said François, "and as to marrying, I
have as much time to think of it as the chestnut in the fire. What I
want to hear from you is whether this girl is better than her brother,
and whether she will prove a source of comfort or trouble to Madeleine,
if she stays on here."
"Heaven knows," said Catherine, "for I do not. Until now, she has been
thoughtless and innocent enough. She likes dress, caps trimmed with
lace, and dancing. She is not very selfish, but she has been so
well-treated and spoiled by Madeleine, that she has never had occasion
to show whether she could bite or not. She has never had anything to
suffer, so we cannot tell what she may be."
"Was she very fond of her brother?"
"Not very, except when he took her to balls, and our mistress tried to
convince him that it was not proper to take a respectable girl in
Sévère's company. Then the little girl, who thought of nothing but her
own pleasure, overwhelmed her brother with attentions, and turned up her
nose at Madeleine, who was obliged to yield. So Mariette does not
dislike Sévère as much as I should wish to have her, but I cannot say
that she is not good-natured and nice to her sister-in-law."
"That will do, Catherine; I ask nothing further. Only I forbid you to
tell the young girl anything of what we have been talking about."
François accomplished successfully all that he had promised Catherine.
By evening, owing to Jeannie's diligence, corn arrived to be ground, and
the mill too was in working order; the ice was broken and melted about
the wheel, the machinery was oiled, and the woodwork repaired, wherever
it was broken. The energetic François worked till two in the morning,
and at four he was up again. He stepped noiselessly into Madeleine's
room, and finding the faithful Catherine on guard, he asked how the
patient was. She had slept well, happy in the arrival of her beloved
servant, and in the efficient aid he brought. Catherine refused to leave
her mistress before Mariette appeared, and François asked at what hour
the beauty of Cormouer was in the habit of rising.
"Not before daylight," said Catherine.
"What? Then you have two more hours to wait, and you will get no sleep
at all."
"I sleep a little in the daytime, in my chair, or on the straw in the
barn, while the cows are feeding."
"Very well, go to bed now," said François, "and I shall wait here to
show the young lady that some people go to bed later than she, and get
up earlier in the morning. I shall busy myself with examining the
miller's papers and those which the bailiffs have brought since his
death. Where are they?"
"There, in Madeleine's chest," said Catherine. "I am going to light the
lamp, François. Come, courage, and try your best to make things
straight, as you seem to understand law-papers."
She went to bed, obeying the commands of the waif as if he were the
master of the house; for true it is that he who has a good head and good
heart rules by his own right.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XIX
BEFORE setting to work, François, as soon as he was left alone with
Madeleine and Jeannie (for the young child always slept in the room with
his mother), went to take a look at the sleeping woman, and thought her
appearance better than when he had first arrived. He was happy to think
that she would have no need of a doctor, and that he alone, by the
comfort he brought, would preserve her health and fortune.
He began to look over the papers, and was soon fully acquainted with
Sévère's claims and the amount of property that Madeleine still
possessed with which to satisfy them. Besides all that Sévère had
already made Cadet Blanchet squander upon her, she declared that she was
still a creditor for two hundred pistoles, and Madeleine had scarcely
anything of her own property left in addition to the inheritance that
Blanchet had bequeathed to Jeannie--an inheritance now reduced to the
mill and its immediate belongings--that is, the courtyard, the meadow,
the outbuildings, the garden, the hemp-field, and a bit of planted
ground; for the broad fields and acres had melted like snow in the
hands of Cadet Blanchet.
"Thank God!" thought François, "I have four hundred pistoles in the
charge of the priest of Aigurande, and in case I can do no better,
Madeleine can still have her house, the income of her mill, and what
remains of her dowry. But I think we can get off more easily than that.
In the first place, I must find out whether the notes signed by Blanchet
to Sévère were not extorted by stratagem and undue influence, and then
I must do a stroke of business on the lands he sold. I understand how
such affairs are managed, and knowing the names of the purchasers, I
will put my hand in the fire if I cannot bring this to a successful
issue."
The fact was that Blanchet, two or three years before his death,
straightened for money and over head and ears in debt to Sévère, had
sold his land at a low price to whomsoever wanted to buy, and turned all
his claims for it over to Sévère, thus expecting to rid himself of her
and of her comrades who had helped her to ruin him. But, as usually
happens in such sales, almost all those who hastened to buy, attracted
by the sweet fragrance of the fertile lands, had not a penny with which
to pay for them, and only discharged the interest with great difficulty.
This state of things might last from ten to twenty years; it was an
investment for Sévère and her friends, but a bad investment, and she
complained loudly of Cadet Blanchet's rashness, and feared that she
would never be paid. So she said, at least; but the speculation was
really a reasonably good one. The peasant, even if he has to lie on
straw, pays his interest, so unwilling is he to let go the bit of land
he holds, which his creditor may seize if he is not satisfied.
We all know this, my good friends, and we often try to grow rich the
wrong way, by buying fine property at a low price. However low it may
be, it is always too high for us. Our covetousness is more capacious
than our purse, and we take no end of trouble to cultivate a field the
produce of which does no cover half the interest exacted by the seller.
When we have delved and sweated all our poor lives, we find ourselves
ruined, and the earth alone is enriched by our pains and toil. Just as
we have doubled its value, we are obliged to sell it. If we could sell
it advantageously, we should be safe; but this is never possible. We
have been so drained by the interest we have had to pay, that we must
sell in haste, and for anything we can get. If we rebel, we are forced
into it by the law-courts, and the man who first sold the land gets back
his property in the condition in which he finds if; that means that for
long years he has placed his land in our hands at eight or ten per cent,
and when he resumes possession of it, it is by our labors, twice as
valuable, in consequence of a careful cultivation which has lost him
neither trouble nor expense, and also by the lapse of time which always
increases the value of property. Thus we poor little minnows are to be
continually devoured by the big fish which pursue us; punished always
for our love of gain, and just as foolish as we were before.
Sévère's money was thus profitably invested in a mortgage at a high
interest, but at the same time she had a firm hold of Cadet Blanchet's
estate, because she had managed him so cleverly that he had pledged
himself for the purchasers of his land, and had gone surety for their
payment.
François saw all this intrigue, and meditated some possible means of
buying back the land at a low price, without ruining anybody, and of
playing a tine trick upon Sévère and her clan, by causing the failure
of their speculation.
It was no easy matter. He had enough money to buy back almost everything
at the price of the original sale, and neither Sévère nor anybody else
could refuse to be reimbursed. The buyers would find it to their profit
to sell again in all haste, in order to escape approaching ruin; for I
tell you all, young and old, if you buy land on credit, you take out a
patent for beggary in your old age. It is useless for me to tell you
this, for you will have the buying mania no whit the less. Nobody can
see a plowed furrow smoking in the sun, without being in a fever to
possess it, and it was the peasant's mad fever to hold on to his own
piece of soil that caused Francois's uneasiness.
Do you know what the soil is, my children? Once upon a time, everybody
in our parishes was talking about it. They said that the old nobles had
attached us to the soil to make us drudge and die, but the Revolution
had burst our bonds, and that we no longer drew our master's cart like
oxen. The truth is that we have bound ourselves to our own acres, and we
drudge and die no less than before.
The city people tell us that our only remedy would be to have no wants or
desires. Only last Sunday, I answered a man who was preaching this
doctrine very eloquently, that if we poor peasants could only be
sensible enough never to eat or sleep, to work all the time, and to
drink nothing but fresh clear water, provided the frogs had no
objection, we might succeed in saving a goodly hoard, and in receiving
a shower of compliments for our wisdom and discretion.
Following this same train of thought, François cudgeled his brains to
find some means of inducing the purchasers of the land to sell it back
again. He finally hit upon the plan of whispering in their ears the
little falsehood, that though Sévère had the reputation of being
fabulously rich, she had really as many debts as a sieve has holes, and
that some fine morning her creditors would lay hands upon all her
claims, as well as upon all her property. He meant to tell them this
confidentially, and when they were thoroughly alarmed, he expected to
buy back Madeleine Blanchet's lands at the original price, with his own
money.
He scrupled, however, to tell this untruth, until it occurred to him
that he could give a small bonus to all the poor purchasers, to make
them amends for the interest they had already paid. In this manner
Madeleine could be restored to her rights and possessions without loss
or injury to the purchasers.
The discredit in which Sévère would be involved by his plan caused him
no scruple whatever. It is right for the hen to pull out a feather from
the cruel bird that has plucked her chickens.
When François had reached this conclusion, Jeannie awoke, and arose
softly, to avoid disturbing his mother's slumbers; then, after a
good-morning to François, he lost no time in going off to announce to
the rest of their customers that the mill was in good order, and that a
strong young miller stood in readiness to grind the corn.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XX
IT was already broad daylight when Mariette Blanchet emerged from her
nest, carefully attired in her mourning, which was so very black and so
very white that she looked as spick and span as a little magpie. The
poor child had one great care, and that was that her mourning would long
prevent her going to dances, and that all her admirers would be missing
her. Her heart was so good that she pitied them greatly.
"How is this?" said she, as she saw François arranging the papers in
Madeleine's room. "You attend to everything here, Master Miller! You
make flour, you settle the business, you mix the medicines; soon we
shall see you sewing and spinning."
"And you, my young lady," said François, who saw that she regarded him
favorably, although she slashed him with her tongue, "I have never as
yet seen you sewing or spinning; I think we shall soon find you sleeping
till noon, and it will do you good, and keep your cheeks rosy!"
"Oho! Master François, you are already beginning to tell me truths
about myself. You had better take care of that little game; I can tell
you something in return."
"I await your pleasure, my young lady."
"It will soon come; do not be afraid, Master Miller. Have the kindness
to tell me where Catherine is, and why you are here watching beside our
patient. Should you like a hood and gown?"
"Are you going to ask, in your turn, for a cap and blouse, so that you
may go to the mill? As I see you do no woman's work, which would be
nursing your sister for a little while, I suppose you would like to sift
out the chaff, and turn the grindstone. At your service. Let us change
clothes."
"It looks as if you were trying to give me a lesson."
"No; you gave me one first, and I am only returning, out of politeness,
what you lent me."
"Good! You like to laugh and tease, but you have chosen the wrong time.
We are not merry here, and it is only a short time ago that we had to go
to the graveyard. If you chatter so much, you will prevent my
sister-in-law from getting the sleep she needs so greatly."
"On that very account, you should not raise your voice so much, my young
lady; for I am speaking very low, and you are not speaking, just now, as
you should in a sick-room."
"Enough, if you please, Master François," said Mariette, lowering her
tone, and flushing angrily. "Be so good as to see if Catherine is at
hand, and tell me why she leaves my sister-in-law in your charge."
"Excuse me, my young lady," said François, with no sign of temper. "She
could not leave her in your charge, because you are too fond of
sleeping, so she was obliged to intrust her to mine. I shall not call
her, because the poor woman is jaded with fatigue. Without meaning to
offend you, I must say that she has been sitting up every night for two
weeks. I sent her off to bed, and, until noon, I mean to do her work and
mine too, for it is only right for us all to help one another."
"Listen, Master François," said the young girl, with a sudden change of
tone; "you appear to hint that I think only of myself and leave all the
work to others. Perhaps I should have sat up in my turn, if Catherine
had told me that she was tired; but she insisted that she was not at all
tired, and I did not understand that my sister was so seriously ill. You
think that I have a bad heart, but I cannot imagine where you have
learned it. You never knew me before yesterday, and we are not, as yet,
intimate enough for you to scold me as you do. You behave exactly as if
you were the head of the family, and yet--"
"Come, out with it, beautiful Mariette, say what you have on the tip of
your tongue. And yet I was taken in and brought up out of charity, is
not it so? And I cannot belong to the family, because I have no family;
I have no right to it, as I am a foundling! Is that all you wanted to
say?"
As François gave Mariette this straightforward answer, he looked at her
in a way that made her blush up to the roots of her hair, for she saw
that his expression was that of a stem and serious person, although he
appeared so serene and gentle that it was impossible to irritate him, or
to make him think or say anything unjust.
The poor child, who was ordinarily so ready with her tongue, was
overawed for a moment, but although she was a little frightened, she
still felt a desire to please this handsome fellow, who spoke so
decidedly and looked her so frankly in the eyes. She was so confused and
embarrassed, that it was with difficulty she restrained her tears, and
she turned her face quickly the other way, to hide her emotion.
He observed it, however, and said very kindly:
"I am not angry, Mariette, and you have no cause to be, on your part. I
think no ill of you; I see only that you are young, that there is
misfortune in the house, and that you are thoughtless. I must tell you
what I think about it."
"What do you think about it?" asked she; "tell me at once, that I may
know whether you are my friend or my enemy."
"I think that you are not fond of the care and pains people take for
those whom they love, who are in trouble. You like to have your time to
yourself, to turn everything into sport, to think about your dress, your
lovers, and your marriage by and by, and you do not mind having others
do your share. If you have any heart, my pretty child, if you really
love your sister-in-law, and your dear little nephew, and even the poor,
faithful servant who is capable of dying in harness like a good horse,
you must wake up a little earlier in the morning, you must care for
Madeleine, comfort Jeannie, relieve Catherine, and, above all, shut your
ears to the enemy of the family, Madame Sévère, who is, I assure you,
a very bad woman. Now you know what I think, neither more nor less."
"I am glad to hear it," said Mariette, rather dryly; "and now please
tell me by what right you wish to make me think as you do."
"Oh! This is the way you take it, is it?" answered François. "My right
is the waif's right, and to tell you the whole truth, the right of the
child who was taken in and brought up by Madame Blanchet; for this, it
is my duty to love her as my mother, and my right to try to requite her
for her kindness."
"I have no fault to find," returned Mariette, "and I see that I cannot
do better than give you my respect at once, and my friendship as time
goes on."
"I like that," said François; "shake hands with me on it."
He strode toward her, holding out his great hand, without the slightest
awkwardness; but the little Mariette was suddenly stung by the fly of
coquetry, and, withdrawing her hand, she announced that it was not
proper to shake hands so familiarly with a young man.
François laughed and left her, seeing plainly that she was not frank,
and that her first object was to entangle him in a flirtation.
"Now, my pretty girl," thought he, "you are much mistaken in me, and we
shall not be friends in the way you mean."
He went up to Madeleine, who had just waked, and who said to him, taking
both his hands in hers:
"I have slept well, my son, and God is gracious to let me see your face
first of all, on waking. How Is it that Jeannie is not with you?"
Then, after hearing his explanation, she spoke some kind words to
Mariette, telling the young girl how sorry she was to have her sit up
all night, and assuring her that she needed no such great care. Mariette
expected François to say that she had risen very late; but François
said nothing and left her alone with Madeleine, who had no more fever
and wanted to try to get up.
After three days, she was so much better that she was able to talk over
business affairs with François.
"You may put yourself at ease, my dear mother," said he. "I sharpened my
wits when I was away from here, and I understand business pretty well. I
mean to see you through these straits, and I shall succeed. Let me have
my way; please do not contradict anything I say, and sign all the papers
I shall bring you. Now, that my mind is at ease on the score of your
health, I am going to town to consult some lawyers. It is market-day,
and I shall find some people there whom I want to see, and I do not
think my time will be wasted."
He did as he said; and after receiving instructions and advice from the
lawyers, he saw clearly that the last promissory notes which Blanchet
had given Sévère would be a good subject for a lawsuit; for he had
signed them when he was beside himself with drink, fever, and
infatuation. Sévère believed that Madeleine would not dare to go to
law, on account of the expense. François was unwilling to advise Madame
Blanchet to embark in a lawsuit, but he thought there was a reasonable
chance of bringing the matter to an amicable close, if he began by
putting a bold face on it; and as he needed somebody to carry a message
into the enemy's camp, he bethought himself of a plan which succeeded
perfectly.
For several days he had watched little Mariette, and assured himself
that she took a daily walk in the direction of Dollins, where Sévère
lived, and that she was on more friendly terms with this woman than he
could wish, chiefly because she met at her house all her young
acquaintances, and some men from town who made love to her. She did not
listen to them, for she was still an innocent girl, and had no idea that
the wolf was so near the sheepfold, but she loved flattery, and was as
thirsty for it as a fly for milk. She kept her walks secret from
Madeleine; and as Madeleine never gossiped with the other women, and had
not as yet left her sick-room, she guessed nothing, and suspected no
evil. Big Catherine was the last person in the world to notice anything,
so that the little girl cocked her cap over her ear, and, under the
pretext of driving the sheep to pasture, she soon left them in charge of
some little shepherd-boy, and was off to play the fine lady in poor
company.
François, however, who was going continually to and fro on the affairs
of the mill, took note of what the girl was doing. He never mentioned it
at home, but turned it to account, as you shall hear.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXI
HE planted himself directly in her way at the river-crossing; and just
as she stepped on the foot-bridge which leads to Dollins, she beheld the
waif, astride of the plank, a leg dangling on each side above the water,
and on his face the expression of a man who has all the time in the
world to spare. She blushed as red as a cherry, and if she had not been
taken so by surprise, she would have swerved aside, and pretended to be
passing by accident.
But the approach to the bridge was obstructed by branches, and she did
not see the wolf till she felt his teeth. His face was turned toward
her, so she had no means of advancing or retreating, without being
observed.
"Master Miller," she began, saucily, "can't you move a hairbreadth to
let anybody pass?"
"No, my young lady," replied François, "for I am the guardian of this
bridge till evening, and I claim the right to collect toll of
everybody."
"Are you mad, François? Nobody pays toll in our country, and you have
no right on any bridge, or foot-bridge, or whatever you may call it in
your country of Aigurande. You may say what you like, but take yourself
off from here, as quickly as you can; this is not the place for jesting;
you will make me tumble into the water."
"Then," said François, without moving, and folding his arms in front of
him, "you think that I want to laugh and joke with you, and that my
right of toll is that of paying you my court? Pray get rid of that idea,
my young lady; I wish to speak sensibly to you, and I will allow you to
pass if you give me permission to accompany you for a short part of your
way."
"That would not be at all proper," said Mariette, somewhat flustered by
her notion of what François was thinking. "What would they say of me
hereabouts, if anybody met me out walking alone with a man to whom I am
not betrothed?"
"You are right," said François; "as Sévère is not here to protect
you, people would talk of you; that is why you are going to her house,
so that you may walk about in her garden with all your admirers. Very
well, so as not to embarrass you, I shall speak to you here, and
briefly, for my business is pressing, and this it is. You are a good
girl; you love your sister-in-law Madeleine; you see that she is in
difficulties, and you must want to help her out of them."
"If that is what you want to say," returned Mariette, "I shall listen to
you, for you are speaking the truth."
"Very well, my dear young lady," said François, rising and leaning
beside her, against the bank beside the little bridge, "you can do a
great service to Madame Blanchet. Since it is for her good and interest,
as I fondly believe, that you are so friendly with Sévère, you must
make that woman agree to a compromise. Sévère is trying to attain two
objects which are incompatible: she wants to make Master Blanchet's
estate security for the payment of the land he sold for the purpose of
paying his debts to her; and in the second place, she means to exact
payment of the notes which he signed in her favor. She may go to law, if
she likes, and wrangle about this poor little estate, but she cannot
succeed in getting more out of it than there is. Make her understand
that if she does not insist upon our guaranteeing the payment of the
land, we can pay her notes; but if she does not allow us to get rid of
one debt, we shall not have funds enough to pay the other, and if she
makes us drain ourselves with expenses which bring her no profit, she
runs the risk of losing everything."
"That is true," said Mariette; "although I understand very little about
business, I think I can understand as much as that. If I am able, by any
chance, to influence her, which would be better: for my sister-in-law to
pay the notes, or to be obliged to redeem the security?"
"It would be worse for her to pay the notes, for it would be more
unjust. We could contest the notes and go to law about them; but the law
requires money, and you know that there is none, and never will be any,
at the mill. So, it is all one to your sister, whether her little all
goes in a lawsuit or in paying Sévère; whereas it is better for
Sévère to be paid, without having a lawsuit.
"As Madeleine is sure to be ruined in either case, she prefers to have
all her possessions seized at once, than to drag on after this under a
heavy burden of debt, which may last all her lifetime; for the
purchasers of Cadet Blanchet's land are not able to pay for it. Sévère
knows this well, and will be forced, some fine day, to take back her
land; but this idea is not at all distressing to her, as it will be a
profitable speculation for her to receive the land in an improved
condition, having long drawn a heavy rate of interest from it. Thus,
Sévère risks nothing in setting us free, and assures the payment of
her notes."
"I shall do as you say," said Mariette; "and if I fail, you may think as
ill of me as you choose."
"Then, good luck, Mariette, and a pleasant walk to you," said François,
stepping out of her way.
Little Mariette started off to Dollins, well pleased to have such a fine
excuse for going there, for staying a long time, and for returning often
during the next few days. Sévère pretended to like what she heard, but
she really determined to be in no haste. She had always hated Madeleine
Blanchet, because of the involuntary respect her husband had felt for
her. She thought she held her safely in her claws for the whole of her
lifetime, and preferred to give up the notes, which she knew to be of no
great value, rather than renounce the pleasure of harassing her with the
burden of an endless debt.
François understood all this perfectly, and was anxious to induce her
to exact the payment of this debt, so that he might have an opportunity
to buy back Jennie's broad fields from those who had purchased them for
a song. When Mariette returned with her answer, he saw that they were
trying to mislead him with words; that, on one hand, the young girl was
glad to have her errands last for a long time to come, and that, on the
other hand. Sévère had not reached the point of being more desirous
for Madeleine's rain than for the payment of her notes.
To clinch matters, he took Mariette aside, two days afterward.
"My dear young lady," said he, "you most not go to Dollins to-day. Your
sister has learned, though I do not know how, that you go there more
than once a day, and she says it is no place for a respectable girl. I
have tried to make her understand that it is for her interest that you
are so friendly with Sévère; but she blamed me as well as you. She
says that she would rather be ruined than have you lose your reputation,
that you are under her guardianship, and that she has authority over
you. If you do not obey of your own free will, you will be prevented
from going by main force. If you do as she says, she will not mention
this to you, as she wishes to avoid giving you pain, but she is very
much displeased with you, and it would be well for you to beg her
pardon."
François had no sooner unleashed the dog than it began to bark and
bite. He was correct in his estimate of little Mariette's temper, which
was as hasty and inflammable as her brother's had been.
"Indeed, indeed!" she exclaimed; "do you expect me to obey my
sister-in-law, as if I were a child of three? You talk as if she were my
mother, and I owed her submission! What makes her think that I may lose
my reputation? Tell her that it is quite as well buckled on as her own,
and perhaps better. Why does she imagine that Sévère is not so good as
other people? Is it wicked not to spend the whole day sewing, spinning,
and praying? My sister-in-law is unjust because she has a quarrel with
her about money, and she thinks she can treat her as she pleases. It is
very imprudent of her, for if Sévère wished she could turn her out of
the house she lives in; and as Sévère is patient, and does not make
use of her advantage, she is certainly better than she is said to be.
And this is the way in which you thank me, who have been obliging enough
to take part in these disputes, which are no concern of mine! I can tell
you, François, that the most respectable people are not always the most
prudish, and when I go to Sévère's I do no more mischief than if I
stayed at home."
"I don't know about that," said François, who was determined to make
all the scum of the vat mount to the surface; "perhaps your sister was
right in thinking that you are in some mischief there. Look here,
Mariette, I see that you like to go there too well. It is not natural.
You have delivered your message about Madeleine's affairs, and since
Sévère has sent no answer, it is evident that she means to give none.
Do not go back there any more, or I shall think, with Madeleine, that
you go with no good intention."
"Then, Master François," cried Mariette, in a fury, "you think you are
going to dictate to me? Do you mean to take my brother's place at home,
and make yourself master there? You have not enough beard on your chin
to give me such a lecture, and I advise you to leave me alone. Your
humble servant," she added, adjusting her coif; "if my sister-in-law
asks where I am, tell her that I am at Sévère's, and if she sends you
after me, you will see how you are received."
She burst the door open violently, and flew off with a light foot toward
Dollins; but as François was afraid that her anger would cool on the
way, especially as the weather was frosty, he allowed her a little
start. He waited until he thought she had nearly reached Sévère's
house, and then putting his long legs in motion he ran like a horse let
loose, and caught up with her, to make her believe that Madeleine had
sent him in pursuit of her.
He was so provoking that she raised her hand against him. He dodged her
every time, being well aware that anger evaporates with blows, and that
a woman's temper improves when she has relieved herself by striking.
Then he ran away, and as soon as Mariette arrived at Sévère's house
she made a great explosion. The poor child had really no bad designs;
but in the first flame of her anger she disclosed everything, and put
Sévère into such a towering passion that François, who was retreating
noiselessly through the lane, heard them at the other end of the
hemp-field, hissing and crackling like fire in a barn full of hay.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXII
HIS plan succeeded admirably, and he was so sure of it that he went over
to Aigurande next day, took his money from the priest, and returned at
night, carrying the four little notes of thin paper, which were of such
great value, and yet made no more noise in his pocket than a crumb of
bread in a cap. After a week's time, Sévère made herself heard. All
the purchasers of Blanchet's land were summoned to pay up, and as not
one was able to do it. Sévère threatened to make Madeleine pay
instead.
Madeleine was much alarmed when she heard the news, for she had received
no hint from François of what was coming.
"Good!" said he to her, rubbing his hands; "a trader cannot always gain,
nor a thief always rob. Madame Sévère is going to make a bad bargain
and you a good one. All the same, my dear mother, you must behave as if
you thought you were ruined. The sadder you are, the gladder she will be
to do what she thinks is to your harm. But that harm is your salvation,
for when you pay Sévère you will buy back your son's inheritance."
"What do you expect me to pay her with, my child?"
"With the money I have in my pocket, and which belongs to you."
Madeleine tried to dissuade him; but the waif was headstrong, as he said
himself, and no one could loose what he had bound. He hastened to
deposit two hundred pistoles with the notary, in the widow Blanchet's
name, and Sévère was paid in full, willingly or unwillingly, and also
all the other creditors of the estate, who had made common cause with
her.
Moreover, after François had indemnified all the poor purchasers of the
land for their losses, he had still enough money with which to go to
law, and he let Sévère know that he was about to embark in a lawsuit
on the subject of the promissory notes which she had wrongfully and
fraudulently extracted from the miller. He set afloat a report which
spread far and wide through the land. He pretended that in fumbling
about an old wall of the mill which he was trying to prop up, he had
found old Mother Blanchet's money-box, filled with gold coins of an
ancient stamp, and that by this means Madeleine was richer than she had
ever been. Weary of warfare, Sévère consented to a compromise, hoping
also that François would be lavish of the crowns winch he had so
opportunely discovered, and that she could wheedle from him more than he
gave her to expect. She got nothing for her pains, however, and he was
so hard with her that she was forced to return the notes in exchange for
a hundred crowns.
To revenge herself, she worked upon little Mariette, telling her that
the money-box of old Mother Blanchet, who was the girl's grandmother,
should have been divided between her and Jeannie, that she had a right
to her share, and should go to law against her sister.
Then the waif was forced to tell the true source of the money he had
provided, and the priest of Aigurande sent him the proofs, in case of
there being a lawsuit.
He began by showing these proofs to Mariette, begging her to make no
unnecessary disclosures, and making it dear to her that she had better
keep quiet. But Mariette would not keep at all quiet; her little brain
was excited by the confusion in the family, and the devil tempted the
poor child. In spite of all the kindness she had received from
Madeleine, who had treated her as a daughter and indulged all her whims,
she felt a dislike and jealousy of her sister-in-law, although her pride
prevented her from acknowledging it. The truth is that in the midst of
her tantrums and quarrels with François, she had inadvertently fallen
in love with him, and never suspected the trap which the devil had set
for her. The more François upbraided her for her faults and vagaries,
the more crazy she was to please him.
She was not the kind of girl to pine and consume away in grief and
tears; but it robbed her of her peace to think that François was so
handsome, rich, and upright, so kind to everybody, and so clever and
brave; that he was a man to shed his last drop of blood for the woman he
loved, and yet that none of this was for her, although she was the
prettiest and richest girl in the neighborhood, and counted her lovers
by the dozen.
One day she opened her heart to her false friend, Sévère. It was in
the pasture at the end of the road of the water-lilies, underneath an
old apple-tree that was then in blossom. While all these things were
happening, the month of May had come, and Sévère strolled out under
the apple-blossoms, to chat with Mariette, who was tending her flock
beside the river.
It pleased God that François, who was near by, should overhear their
conversation. He had seen Sévère enter the pasture, and at once
suspected her of meditating some intrigue against Madeleine; and as the
river was low, he walked noiselessly along the bank, beneath the bushes
which are so tall just there that a hay-cart could pass under their
shade. When he came within hearing distance, he sat down on the ground,
without making a sound, and opened his ears very wide.
The two women plied their tongues busily. In the first place, Mariette
confessed to not caring for a single one of her suitors, for the sake of
a young miller, who was not at all courteous to her, and the thought of
whom kept her awake at night. Sévère, on the other hand, wanted to
unite her to a young man of her acquaintance, who was so much in love
with the girl, that he had promised a handsome wedding-present to
Sévère, if she succeeded in marrying him to Mariette Blanchet. It
appeared also that Sévère had exacted a gratuity beforehand from him
and from several others; so she naturally did all in her power to put
Mariette out of conceit with François.
"A plague take the waif!" she exclaimed. "What, Mariette, a girl in your
position marry a foundling! You would be called Madame Strawberry, for
he has no other name. I should be ashamed for you, my poor darling. Then
you have no chance; you would be obliged to light for him with your
sister-in-law, for he is her lover, as true as I live."
"Sévère," cried Mariette, "you have hinted this to me more than once;
but I cannot believe you; my sister-in-law is too old."
"No, no, Mariette; your sister-in-law is not old enough to do without
this sort of thing; she is only thirty, and when the waif was but a boy,
your brother discovered that he was too familiar with his wife. That is
why he gave him a sound thrashing with the butt of his whip, and turned
him out of doors."
François felt a lively desire to spring out of the bushes and tell
Sévère that she lied; but he restrained himself, and sat motionless.
Sévère continued to ring the changes on this subject, and told so many
shocking lies that François's face burned, and it was with great
difficulty that he kept his patience.
"Then," said Mariette, "he probably means to marry her now that she is a
widow; he has already given her a good part of his fortune, and he must
wish to have a share in the property which he has bought back."
"Somebody else will outbid him," said the other; "for now that Madeleine
has plundered him, she will be on the lookout for a richer suitor, and
will be sure to find one. She must take a husband to manage her
property, but while she is trying to find him, she keeps this great
simpleton with her, who serves her for nothing, and amuses her
solitude."
"If she is going along at that pace," said Mariette, much vexed, "I am
in a most disreputable house; in which I run too many dangers! Do you
consider, my dear Sévère, that I am very ill-lodged, and that people
will talk against me? Indeed, I cannot stay where I am; I must leave.
Oh! yes, these pious women criticize everybody else, because they
themselves are shameless only in God's sight! I should like to hear her
say anything against you and me now! Very well! I am going to say
good-by to her, and I am coming to live with you; if she is angry, I
shall answer her; if she tries to bring me back by force, to live with
her, I shall go to law; and I shall let people know what she is--do you
hear?"
"A better remedy for you, Mariette, is to get married as soon as
possible. She will not refuse her consent, because I am sure she is
anxious to rid herself of you. You stand in the way of her relations
with the handsome waif. You must not delay, cannot you understand, for
people will say that he belongs to both of you, and then nobody will
marry you. Go and get married, then, and take the man I advise."
"Agreed," said Mariette, breaking her shepherd's crook violently,
against the old apple-tree. "I give you my word. Go and tell him,
Sévère; let him come to my house this evening, to ask for my hand, and
let our banns be published next Sunday."

CHAPTER XXIII
FRANÇOIS was never sadder than when he emerged from the river-bank
where he had hidden himself to listen to the women's talk. His heart was
as heavy as lead, and when he had gone half-way home he lost courage to
return, and, stepping aside into the path of the water-lilies, he sat
down in the little grove of oaks, at the end of the meadow.
Once there, by himself, he wept like a child, and his heart was bursting
with sorrow and shame; for he was ashamed to hear of what he was
accused, and to think that his poor dear friend Madeleine, whom, through
all his life, he had loved so purely and constantly, reaped nothing but
insult and slander from his devotion and fidelity.
"Oh! my God, my God!" said he to himself, "how can it be that the world
is so wicked and that a woman like Sévère can have the insolence to
measure the honor of a woman like my dear mother, by her own standard?
And that little Mariette, who should naturally be inclined to innocence
and truth, a child as she is, who does not as yet know the meaning of
evil, even she listens to this infernal calumny, and believes in it, as
if she knew how it stung! Since this is so, others will believe it too;
as the larger part of people living mortal life are old in evil, almost
everybody win think that because I love Madame Blanchet, and she loves
me, there must be something dishonorable in it."
Then poor François undertook a careful examination of his conscience,
and searched his memory to see whether, by any fault of his, he were
responsible for Sévère's wicked gossip; whether he had behaved wisely
in all respects, or whether, by a lack of prudence and discretion, he
had involuntarily given rise to evil thinking. But it was in vain that
he reflected, for he could not believe that he had appeared guilty of
what had never even crossed his mind.
Still absorbed in thought and reverie, he went on saying to himself:
"Suppose that my liking had turned to loving, what harm would it be in
God's sight, now that she is a widow and her own mistress? I have given
a good part of my fortune to her and Jeannie, but I still have a
considerable share left, and she would not wrong her child if she
married me. It would not be self-seeking on my part to desire this, and
nobody could make her believe that my love for her is self-interested.
I am a foundling, but she does not care for that. She has loved me with
a mother's love, which is the strongest of all affections, and now she
might love me in another way. I see that her enemies will force me to
leave her if I do not marry her, and I should rather die than leave her
a second time. Besides, she needs my help, and I should be a coward to
leave her affairs in such disorder when I have strength as well as money
with which to serve her. Yes, all I have should belong to her, and as
she often talks to me about paying me back in the end, I must put that
idea out of her head, by sharing all things in common with her, in
accordance with the permission of God and the law. She must keep her
good name for her son's sake, and she can save it only by marrying me.
How is it that I never thought of this before, and that I needed to hear
it suggested by a serpent's tongue? I was too simple-minded and
unsuspecting; and my poor mother is too charitable to others to take to
heart the injuries which are done her. Everything tends toward good, by
the will of Heaven; and Madame Sévère, who was plotting mischief, has
done me the service of teaching me my duty."
Without indulging any longer in meditation or wonder, François set off
on his way home, determined to speak of his plan to Madame Blanchet
without loss of time, and on his knees to entreat her to accept him as
her protector, in the name of God, and for eternal life.
When he reached Cormouer, he saw Madeleine spinning on her door-step, and
for the first time in his life her face had the effect of making him
timid and confused. He was in the habit of walking straight up to her,
looking her full in the face to ask her how she did; but this time he
paused on the little bridge as if he were examining the mill-dam, and
only looked at her out of the corners of his eyes.
When she turned toward him, he moved farther away, not understanding
himself what his trouble was, or why a matter which, a few minutes ago,
had seemed to him so natural and opportune, should suddenly become so
awkward to confess.
Madeleine called him.
"Come here to me," said she, "for I have something to say to you, dear
François. We are alone, so come and sit down beside me, and open your
heart to me, as if I were your father-confessor, for I want to hear the
truth from you."
François was reassured by Madeleine's words, and he sat down beside
her.
"I promise, my dear mother," said he, "to open my heart to you as I do
to God, and to give you a true confession."
He fancied that something had come to her ears which had brought her to
the same conclusion as himself; he was delighted, and waited to hear
what she had to say.
"François," she went on, "you are in your twenty-first year, and it is
time for you to think of marrying; you are not opposed to it, I hope?"
"No, I am not opposed to anything you wish," answered François,
blushing with pleasure; "go on, my dear Madeleine."
"Good!" said she. "I expected this, and I have guessed the right thing.
Since you wish it, I wish it too, and perhaps I thought of it before you
did. I was waiting to see whether the person in question cared for you,
and I think that if she does not as yet, she will, very soon. Don't you
think so, too, and shall I tell you where you stand? Why do you look at
me with such a puzzled expression? Don't I speak clearly enough? I see
that you are shy about it, and I must help you out. Well, the poor child
pouted all the morning because you teased her a little yesterday, and I
dare say she thinks you do not love her. But I know that you do love
her, and if you scold her sometimes for her little caprices it is
because you are a trifle jealous. You must not hold back for that,
François. She is young and pretty; but though there is some danger in
this, if she truly loves you she will willingly submit herself to you."
"I should like," said François, much disappointed, "to know whom you
are talking of, my dear mother, for I am wholly at a loss."
"Really!" said Madeleine; "don't you know what I mean? Am I dreaming, or
are you trying to keep a secret from me?"
"A secret from you!" said François, taking Madeleine's hand. He soon
dropped it, and took up instead the corner of her apron, which he
crumpled as if he were provoked, then lifted toward his lips as if about
to kiss it, and finally let go just as he had done with her hand. He was
first inclined to cry; then he felt angry, and then giddy, all in
succession.
Madeleine was amazed.
"You are in trouble, my child," she cried, "and this means that you are
in love--that all does not go as you wish. I can assure you that
Mariette has a good heart; she, too, is distressed, and if you speak
openly with her she will tell you, in return, that she thinks of no one
but you."
François sprang up, and walked up and down the courtyard for some time
in silence; then he returned to Madeleine's side.
"I am very much surprised to hear what you have in your mind, Madame
Blanchet; this never once occurred to me, and I am well aware that
Mariette has no liking for me, and that I am not to her taste."
"Oh, come!" said Madeleine; "you are speaking petulantly, my child! Don't
you think I noticed how often you talked with her? Though I could not
catch the meaning of what you said, it was evident that she understood
very well, for her face glowed like a burning coal. Do you think I do
not know that she runs away from the pasture every day, leaving her
flock in charge of the first person she meets? Her sheep flourish at the
expense of our wheat; but I do not want to cross her, or talk to her of
sheep, when her head is full of nothing but love and marriage. The poor
child is just of an age to guard her sheep ill, and her heart still
worse. But it is great good luck for her, François, that instead of
falling in love with one of those bad fellows whom I was so much afraid
of her meeting at Sévère's, she had the good sense to think of you. It
makes me, too, very happy to think that, when you are married to my
sister-in-law, who is almost the same as a daughter to me, you will live
with me and make part of my family, and that I may harbor you in my
house, work with you, bring up your children, and thus repay your
kindness to me. So, do not let your childish notions interfere with all
the joys I have planned. Try to see clearly, and forget your jealousy.
If Mariette is fond of dress, it is because she is anxious to please
you. If she has been rather idle lately, it is only because she is
thinking too much of you; and if she answers me sometimes rather
sharply, she does so because she is vexed with your reprimands, and does
not know whom to blame for them. The proof that she is good and desirous
of mending her ways, is that she has recognized your goodness and
wisdom, and wants you for her husband."
"You are good, my dear mother," said François, quite crestfallen. "Yes,
it is you who are good, for you believe in the goodness of others and
deceive yourself. I can tell you that, if Mariette is good, too, and I
will not say she is not, lest I should injure her in your opinion, it is
in a way very different from yours, and, consequently, very displeasing
to me. Do not say anything more to me about her. I swear to you on my
word and honor, on my heart and soul, that I am no more in love with her
than I am with old Catherine, and if she has any regard for me, it is
her own misfortune, because I cannot return it. Do not try to make her
say she loves me; your tact would be at fault, and you would make her my
enemy. It is quite the contrary; hear what she will say to you to-night,
and let her marry Jean Aubard, whom she has made up her mind to accept.
Let her marry as soon as possible, for she is out of place in your
house. She is not happy there, and will not be a source of comfort to
you."
"Jean Aubard!" exclaimed Madeleine; "he is not a proper person for her;
he is a fool, and she is too clever to submit herself to a stupid man."
"He is rich, and she will not submit to him. She will manage him, and he
is just the man for her. Will you not trust in your friend, my dear
mother? You know that, up to this time, I have never given you any bad
advice. Let the young girl go; she does not love you as she ought, and
she does not know your worth."
"You say this because your feelings are hurt, François," said
Madeleine, laying her hand on his head and moving it gently up and down,
as if she were trying to shake the truth out of it François was
exasperated that she would not believe him, and it was the first time in
his life that there had been any dispute between them. He withdrew,
saying in a dissatisfied tone of voice:
"Madame Blanchet, you are not just to me. I tell you that girl does not
love you. You force me to say this, against my will; for I did not come
here to bring distrust and strife. So, if I tell it to you, you may know
that I am sure of it; and do you think I can love her after that? You
cannot love me any more, if you will not believe me."
Wild with grief, François rushed off to weep all alone by the fountain.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXIV
MADELEINE was still more perplexed than François, and was on the point
of following him with questions and words of encouragement; but she was
held back by the sudden appearance of Mariette, who, with a strange
expression on her face, announced the offer of marriage she had received
from Jean Aubard. Madeleine, who was unable to disabuse herself of the
idea that the whole affair was the result of a lovers' quarrel,
attempted to speak to the girl of François; but Mariette answered in a
tone which gave her great pain, and was utterly incomprehensible to her:
"Those people who care for foundlings may keep them for their own
amusement; I am an honest girl, and shall not allow my good name to
suffer because my poor brother is dead. I am perfectly independent,
Madeleine; and if I am forced by law to ask your advice, I am not forced
to take it when it is not for my good. So please do not stand in my way,
or I may stand in yours hereafter."
"I cannot imagine what is the matter with you, my dear child," said
Madeleine, very sweetly and sadly. "You speak to me as if you had
neither respect nor affection for me. I think you must be in some
distress which has confused your mind; so I entreat you to take three or
four days, in which to decide. I shall tell Jean Aubard to come back,
and if you are of the same opinion after a little quiet reflection, I
shall give you free leave to marry him, as he is a respectable man, and
comfortably off. But you are in such an excited condition, just now,
that you cannot know your own mind, and you shut your heart against my
affection. You grieve me very much, but as I see that you are grieved
too, I forgive you."
Mariette tossed her head, to show how much she despised that sort of
forgiveness, and ran away to put on her silk apron and prepare for the
reception of Jean Aubard, who arrived, an hour later, with big Sévère
in gala dress.
This time, at last, Madeleine was convinced of Mariette's ill-will
toward her, since the girl had brought into her house, on a family
matter, a woman who was her enemy, and whom she blushed to see.
Notwithstanding this, she advanced very politely to meet Sévère, and
served her with refreshments, without any appearance of anger or
dislike; for she feared that if Mariette were opposed, she would prove
unmanageable. So Madeleine said that she made no objection to her
sister-in-law's desire, but requested three days' grace before giving
her answer.
Thereupon Sévère said, insolently, that was a very long time to wait.
Madeleine answered quietly that it was a very short time.
Jean Aubard then left, looking like a blockhead, and giggling like a
booby, for he was sure that Mariette was madly in love with him. He had
paid well for this illusion, and Sévère gave him his money's worth.
As Sévère left the house, she said to Mariette that she had ordered a
cake and some sweets at home for the betrothal, and even if Madame
Blanchet delayed the preliminaries, they must sit down to the feast.
Madeleine objected that it was not proper for a young girl to go off in
the company of a man who had not as yet received his answer from her
family.
"If that is so, I shall not go," said Mariette, in a huff.
"Oh, yes, yes; you must come," Sévère insisted; "are not you your own
mistress?"
"No, indeed," returned Mariette; "you see my sister-in-law forbids me to
go."
She went into her room and slammed the door; but she merely passed
through the house, went out by the back door, and caught up with
Sévère and her suitor at the end of the meadow, laughing and jeering
at Madeleine's expense.
Poor Madeleine could not restrain her tears when she saw how things were
going.
"François was right," thought she; "the girl does not love me, and she
is ungrateful at heart. She will not believe that I am acting for her
good, that I am most anxious for her happiness, and wish only to prevent
her doing something which she will regret hereafter. She has taken evil
counsel, and I am condemned to see that wretched Sévère stirring up
trouble and strife in my family. I have not deserved all these troubles,
and I must submit to God's will. Fortunately, poor François was more
clear-sighted than I. How much he would suffer with such a wife!"
She went to look for him, to let him know what she thought; but when she
found him in tears beside the fountain, she supposed he was grieving for
the loss of Mariette, and attempted to comfort him. The more she said
the more pained he was, for it became clear to him that she refused to
understand the truth, and that her heart could never feel for him in the
way he had hoped.
In the evening, when Jeannie was in bed and asleep, François sat with
Madeleine, and sought to explain himself.
He began by saying that Mariette was jealous of her, and that Sévère
had slandered her infamously; but Madeleine never dreamed of his
meaning.
"What can she say against me?" said she, simply; "and what jealousy can
she put into poor silly little Mariette's head? You are mistaken,
François; something else is at stake, some interested reason which we
shall hear later. It is not possible that she should be jealous; I am
too old to give any anxiety to a young and pretty girl. I am almost
thirty, and for a peasant woman who has undergone a great deal of
trouble and fatigue, that is old enough to be your mother. The devil
only could say that I think of you in any way but as my son, and
Mariette must know I longed to have you both marry. No, no; never
believe that she has any such evil thought, or, at least, do not mention
it to me, for I should be too much pained and mortified."
"And yet," said François, making a great effort to speak, and bending
low over the fire to hide his confusion from Madeleine, "Monsieur
Blanchet had some such evil thought when he turned me out of doors!"
"What! Do you know that now, François?" exclaimed Madeleine. "How is it
that you know it? I never told you, and I never should have told you. If
Catherine spoke of it to you, she did wrong. Such an idea must shock and
pain you as much as it does me, but we must try not to think of it any
more and to forgive my husband, now that he is dead. All the obloquy of
it falls upon Sévère; but now Sévère can be no longer jealous of me.
I have no husband, and I am as old and ugly as she could ever have
wished, though I am not in the least sorry for it, for I have gained the
right of being respected, of treating you as a son, and of finding you a
pretty young wife, who will live happily with me and love me as a
mother. This is my only wish, François, and you must not distress
yourself, for we shall find her. So much the worse for Mariette if she
despises the happiness I had in store for her. Now, go to bed, my child,
and take courage. If I thought I were any obstacle to your marrying, I
should send you away at once; but you may be sure that nobody worries
about me, or imagines what is absolutely impossible."
As François listened to Madeleine, he was convinced that she was right,
so accustomed was he to believe all that she said. He rose to bid her
good night, but, as he took her hand, it happened that, for the first
time in his life, he looked at her with the intention of finding out
whether she were old and ugly; and the truth is, she had long been so
sad and serious that she deceived herself, and was still as pretty a
woman as she had ever been.
So when François saw all at once that she was still young and as
beautiful as the blessed Virgin, his heart gave a great bound, as if he
had climbed to the pinnacle of a tower. He went back for the night to
the mill, where his bed was neatly spread in a square of boards among
the sacks of flour. Once there, and by himself, he shivered and gasped
as if he had a fever; but it was only the fever of love, for he who had
all his life warmed himself comfortably in front of the ashes, had
suddenly been scorched by a great burst of flame.
[Illustration]
CHAPTER XXV
FROM that time on, the waif was so melancholy that it made one's heart
ache to see him. He worked like a horse, but he found no more joy or
peace, and Madeleine could not induce him to say what was the matter
with him. It was in vain he swore that he neither loved nor regretted
Mariette, for Madeleine would not believe him, and could assign no other
cause for his depression. She was grieved that he should be in distress
and yet no longer confide in her, and she was amazed that his trouble
should make him so proud and self-willed.
As it was not in her nature to be tormenting, she made up her mind to
say nothing further to him on the subject. She attempted to make
Mariette reverse her decision, but her overtures were so ill-received
that she lost courage, and was silent. Though her heart was full of
anguish, she kept it to herself, lest she should add to the burden of
others.
François worked for her, and served her with the same zeal and devotion
as before. As in the old time, he stayed as much as possible in her
company, but he no longer spoke as he used. He was always embarrassed
with her, and turned first red as fire, and then white as a sheet in the
same minute. She was afraid he was ill, and once took his hand to see if
he were feverish; but he drew back from her as if her touch hurt him,
and sometimes he reproached her in words which she could not understand.
The trouble between them grew from day to day. During all this time,
great preparations were being made for Mariette's marriage to Jean
Aubard, and the day which was to end her mourning was fixed as that of
the wedding.
Madeleine looked forward to that day with dread; she feared that
François would go crazy, and was anxious to send him to spend a little
time at Aigurande, with his old master Jean Vertaud, so as to distract
his mind. François, however, was unwilling to let Mariette believe what
Madeleine insisted upon thinking. He showed no vexation before her, was
on friendly relations with her lover, and jested with Sévère, when he
met her along the road, to let her see that he had nothing to fear from
her. He was present at the wedding; and as he was really delighted to
have the house rid of the girl, and Madeleine freed from her false
friendship, it never crossed anybody's mind that he had been in love
with her. The truth began to dawn even on Madeleine, or at least she was
inclined to believe that he had consoled himself. She received
Mariette's farewell with her accustomed warmth of heart; but as the
young girl still cherished a grudge against her on account of the waif,
Madeleine could not help seeing that her sister-in-law left her without
love or regret. Inured as she was to sorrow, Madeleine wept over the
girl's hardness of heart, and prayed God to forgive her.
After a week had passed, François unexpectedly told her that he had
some business at Aigurande that would call him there for the space of
five or six days. She was not surprised, and hoped it would be for the
good of his health, for she believed that he had stifled his grief, and
was ill in consequence.
But that grief, which she thought he had overcome, increased with him
day by day. He could think of nothing else, and whether asleep or awake,
far or near, Madeleine was always in his heart and before his eyes. It
is true that all his life had been spent in loving her and thinking of
her, but until lately these thoughts of her had been has happiness and
consolation, whereas they were now his despair and his undoing. As long
is he was content to be her son and friend, he wished for no better lot
on earth; but now his love had changed its character, and he was
exquisitely unhappy. He fancied that she could never change as he had
done. He kept repeating to himself that he was too young, that she had
known him as a forlorn and wretched child, that he could be only an
object of care and compassion to her, and never of pride. In short, he
believed her to be so lovely and so attractive, so far above him, and so
much to be desired, that when she said she was no longer young and
pretty, he thought she was adopting a rôle to scare away her suitors.
In the mean time, Sévère, Mariette, and their clan were slandering her
openly on his account, and he was in terror lest some of the scandal
should come to her ears, and she should be displeased and long for his
departure. He knew she was too kind to ask him to go, but he dreaded
being again a cause of annoyance to her, as he had been once before, and
it occurred to him to go to ask the advice of the priest of Aigurande,
whom he had found to be a just and God-fearing man.
He went, but with no success, as the priest was absent on a visit to his
bishop; so François returned to the mill of Jean Vertaud, who had
invited him for a few days' visit, while waiting for the priest's
return.
He found his kind master as true a man and as faithful a friend as he
had left him, and his good daughter Jeannette on the brink of marriage
with a very respectable man whom she had accepted from motives of
prudence rather than of enthusiasm, but for whom she fortunately felt
more liking than distaste. This put François more at his ease with her
than he had ever been, and the next day being Sunday, he had a long talk
with her, and confided in her Madame Blanchet's many difficulties, and
his satisfaction in rescuing her from them.
Jeannette was quick-witted, and from one thing and another she guessed
that the waif was more agitated by his attachment to Madeleine than he
would confess. She laid her hand on his arm, and said to him abruptly:
"François, you must hide nothing from me. I have come to my senses now,
and you see that I am not ashamed to tell you that I once thought more
of you than you did of me. You knew my feelings, and you could not
return them, but you would not deceive me, and no selfish interest led
you to do what many others would have done in your place. I respect you
both for your behavior toward me and for your constancy to the woman you
loved best in the world; and instead of disowning my regard for you, I
am glad to remember it. I expect you to think the better of me for
acknowledging it, and to do me the justice to observe that I bear no
grudge or malice toward you for your coolness. I mean to give you the
greatest possible token of my esteem. You love Madeleine Blanchet, not
indeed as a mother, but as a young and attractive woman, whom you wish
for your wife."
"Oh!" said François, blushing like a girl, "I love her as a mother, and
my heart is full of respect for her."
"I have no doubt of it," answered Jeannette; "but you love her in two
ways, for your face says one thing and your words another. Very well,
François; you dare not tell her what you dare not even confess to me,
and you do not know whether she can answer your two ways of loving."
Jeannette Vertaud spoke with so much sense and sweetness, and showed
François such true friendship, that he had not the courage to deceive
her, and pressing her hand, he told her that she was like a sister to
him, and the only person in the world to whom he had the heart to
disclose his secret.
Jeannette asked him several questions, which he answered truly and
openly.
"François, my friend," said she, "I understand it all. It is impossible
for me to know what Madeleine Blanchet will think about it; but I see
that you might be for years in her company without having the boldness
to tell her what you have on your mind. No matter. I shall find out for
you, and shall let you know. My father and you and I shall set out
to-morrow for a friendly visit to Cormouer, as if we went to make the
acquaintance of the kind woman who brought up our friend François; you
must take my father to walk about the place, under pretext of asking his
advice, and I shall spend the time talking with Madeleine. I shall use a
great deal of tact, and shall not tell what your feelings are until I am
certain of hers."
François was so grateful to Jeannette that he was ready to fall on his
knees before her; and Jean Vertaud, who, with the waif's permission, was
informed of the situation, gave his consent to the plan. Next day they
set out; Jeannette rode on the croup behind her father, and François
started an hour earlier than they to prepare Madeleine for the visit she
was to receive.
The sun was setting as François approached Cormouer. A storm came up
during his ride, and he was drenched to the skin; but he never murmured,
for he had good hope in Jeannette's friendly offices, and his heart was
lighter than when he had left home. The water was dripping from the
bushes, and the blackbirds were singing like mad in thankfulness for a
last gleam from the sun before it sank behind the hill of Grand-Corlay.
Great flocks of birds fluttered from branch to branch around François,
and their joyous chattering cheered his spirits. He thought of the time
when he was little, and roamed about the meadows, whistling to attract
the birds, absorbed in his childish dreams and fancies. Just then a
handsome bullfinch hovered round his head, like a harbinger of good luck
and good tidings, and his thoughts wandered back to his Mother Zabelle
and the quaint songs of the olden time, with which she used to sing him
to sleep.
Madeleine did not expect him so soon. She had even feared that he would
never come back at all, and when she caught sight of him, she could not
help running to kiss him, and was surprised to see how much it made him
blush. He announced the approaching visit, and apparently as much afraid
of having her guess his feelings as he was grieved to have her ignore
them, in order to prevent her suspecting anything, he told her that Jean
Vertaud thought of buying some land in the neighborhood.
Then Madeleine bestirred herself to prepare the best entertainment she
could offer to François's friends.
Jeannette was the first to enter the house, while her father was putting
up their horse in the stable; and as soon as she saw Madeleine, she took
a great liking for her, a liking which the other woman fully returned.
They began by shaking hands, but they soon fell to kissing each other
for the sake of their common love for François, and they spoke together
freely, as if they had had a long and intimate acquaintance. The truth
is they were both excellent women, and made such a pair as is hard to
find. Jeannette could not help a pang on seeing Madeleine, whom she knew
to be idolized by the man for whom she herself still cherished a
lingering fondness; but she felt no jealousy, and tried to forget her
grief in the good action on which she was bent. On the other hand, when
Madeleine saw the young woman's sweet face and graceful figure, she
supposed that it was she whom François had loved and pined for, that
they were now betrothed, and that Jeannette had come to bring the news
in person; but neither did she feel any jealousy, for she had never
thought of François save as her own child.
In the evening, after supper, Father Vertaud, who was tired by his ride,
went to bed; and Jeannette took Madeleine out into the garden with her,
after first instructing François to keep a little aloof with Jeannie,
but still near enough to see her let down the corner of her apron, which
she wore tucked up on one side, for this was to be the signal for him to
join them. She then fulfilled her mission conscientiously, and so
skilfully that Madeleine had no time to exclaim, although beyond measure
astonished, as the matter was unfolded to her. At first she thought it
but another proof of François's goodness of heart, that he wished to
put a stop to all evil gossip, and to devote his life to her service;
and she would have refused, thinking it too great a sacrifice on the
part of so young a man to marry a woman older than himself. She feared
he would repent later, and could not long keep his faith to her, without
vexation and regret; but Jeannette gave her to understand that the waif
was in love with her, heart and soul, and that he was losing his health
and peace of mind because of her.
This was inconceivable to Madeleine. She had lived such a sober and
retired life, never adorning her person, never appearing in public, nor
listening to flattery, that she had no longer any idea of the impression
she might make upon a man.
"Then," said Jeannette, "since he loves you so much, and will die if you
refuse him, will you persist in closing your eyes and ears to what I say
to you? If you do, it must be because you dislike the poor young fellow,
and would be sorry to make him happy."
"Do not say that, Jeannette," answered Madeleine; "I love him almost, if
not quite, as much as my Jeannie, and if I had ever suspected that he
thought of me in another light, it is quite possible that my affection
for him would have been more passionate. But what can you expect? I
never dreamed of this, and I am still so dazed that I do not know how to
answer. I ask for time to think of it and to talk it over with him, so
that I may find out whether he does this from a whim or out of mere
pique, or whether, perhaps, he thinks it is a duty he owes me. This I am
afraid of most of all, and I think he has repaid me fully for the care I
took of him, and it would be too much for him to give me his liberty and
himself, at least unless he loves me as you think he does."
When Jeannette heard these words, she let down the corner of her apron,
and François, who was waiting near at hand with his eyes fixed upon
her, was beside them in an instant. The clever Jeannette asked Jeannie
to show her the fountain, and they strolled off together, leaving
Madeleine and François together.
But Madeleine, who had expected to put her questions to the waif, in
perfect calmness, was suddenly covered with shyness and confusion, like
a young girl; for confusion such as hers, so sweet and pleasant to see,
belongs to no age, but is bred of innocence of mind and purity of life.
When François saw that his dear mother blushed and trembled as he did,
he received it as a more favorable token than if she had kept her usual
serene manner. He took her hand and arm, but he could not speak.
Trembling all the while, she tried to shake herself loose and to follow
Jeannie and Jeannette, but he held her fast, and made her turn back with
him. When Madeleine saw his boldness in opposing his will to hers, she
understood, better than if he had spoken, that it was no longer her
child, the waif, but her lover, François, that walked by her side.
After they had gone a little distance, silent, but linked arm in arm, as
vine is interlaced with vine, François said:
"Let us go to the fountain; perhaps I may find my tongue there."
They did not find Jeannie and Jeannette beside the fountain, for they
had gone home; but François found courage to speak, remembering that it
was there he had seen Madeleine for the first time, and there, too, he
had bidden her farewell, eleven years afterward. We must believe that he
spoke very fluently, and that Madeleine did not gainsay him, for they
were still there at midnight. She was crying for joy, and he was on his
knees before her, thanking her for accepting him for her husband.

"There ends the story," said the hemp-dresser, "for it would take too
long to tell you about the wedding. I was present, myself, and the same
day the waif married Madeleine in the parish of Mers, Jeannette was
married in the parish of Aigurande. Jean Vertaud insisted that François
and his wife, and Jeannie, who was happy as a king, with their friends,
relations, and acquaintances, should come to his house for the
wedding-feast, which was finer, grander, and more delightful than
anything I have ever seen since."
"Is the story true in all points?" asked Sylvine Courtioux.
"If it is not, it might be," answered the hemp-dresser. "If you do not
believe me, go and see for yourself."

International Cartoons of the War
INTRODUCTION
THE HISTORIAN who, a couple of centuries hence, tries to get at the
real kernel of the great War, will find himself overwhelmed with
material, buried under evidence, like the great authority on Penguinia.
Every doubtful point will be clearly and irrefutably decided for him
in at least seven different ways. A burning sense of conviction may
be his, but he will not be sure which conviction it is. The lot of
the historian has changed for the worse since the days of Herodotus.
It no longer suffices for an account of a battle to be possible if
not probable, marvellous if not possible, for it to rank as history;
mankind chose to start on the thorny quest of Truth, and is now
beginning to see that in every affair there are exactly as many Truths
as there are actors.
When the war broke out in August, 1914, the curious art of conveying
a knowledge of thoughts and fact between two or more human organisms,
the only art or appliance which man has really invented without
referring to Nature—the art of writing—was resorted to on every
hand. An unprecedented crop of war books began to sprout from the
blood-fertilized fields of Flanders. Men might safely exclaim: "Mine
enemy hath written a book"; they had perforce to add: "And so hath
each of my friends." They poured from the Press, little books and big,
sober and hysterical, speculative and emotional. After them came the
sedate polychromatic procession of Government literature. Along with
them flowed the swift and multitudinous efforts of journalism. And in
a very short time began those strange enterprises, at once droll and
portentous, the Serial Histories of the War.
What the great historian will make of all this when his time comes to
correlate it, it is difficult to say. If he feel conscientiously bound
to consult contemporary evidence, there is little hope for him, unless
he takes the bold step of writing a historical novel out of his inner
consciousness instead.
But there will be at least one unfailing guide for him. The very
increase in mechanical processes which contributes to his undoing in
the matter of books, will come to his aid with regard to pictures.
Every great event since the invention of mechanical reproductive
processes has produced its due reflection in the mirror of the artist.
The crude old broadsheets told their tale of the Napoleonic wars
more vividly than any historian could; and the present struggle,
while it slew nearly every other art for the time being, worked up to
fever-pitch the output of pictorial comment. In France, where this
form of expression has always been popular, an unexampled flood of
cartoon and caricature poured from artists both celebrated and unknown.
Other countries followed suit, in proportion to their national liking
for prints; and the evidence supplied by this mass of international
material is as direct and reliable as anyone need demand.
II.
THE VALUE of the contemporary cartoon is very great; for it deals
almost entirely with what people are feeling, in distinction to what
they are doing. It uses their deeds as a mere background to their
emotions, and it is only the emotions which count. What the soldier
feels, the sailor, the mother at home, the man in the street—these
are the really important things, for it is these things which are the
causes of events. If enough ordinary people want peace at any price,
the Governments of all the States in the world will be powerless to
wage war one moment longer; if enough ordinary people consider their
honour involved in fighting to a finish, emperors and kings and
presidents and trade unions and the N.C.C. will united be unable to
break the smallest twig from the olive.
The material of the cartoonist is drawn from sources useless to the
writer, or at best, of only ephemeral utility. A chance-heard remark,
the expression of a face seen in the street, the glances turned on a
wounded man as he hobbles by on his stick, the ineptitude of a comment
on the day's news—these are the media by which the cartoonist conveys
his view of what his country feels. And he has this advantage over the
writer—that a well-done drawing is a volume in itself; in one glance
the eye has absorbed the background which a tedious explanation is
necessary to convey in words, and is free to take in the essential
meaning of the drawing. A picture appeals as directly to the eye as
does a sunset, or as food to the stomach, or a soft bed to the tired
body. It uses a natural sense, not a cultivated faculty.
Cartoons are meant for the man in the street; they are meant to tell
a story, to convey some feeling or idea rather than to be an artistic
rendering of an object or collection of objects. Therefore artistic
canons apply to them in this limited sense—that while the great
cartoonist may and must be as big an artist as he can, he must first
of all remember that he has to explain himself and his subjects, or
he ceases to be a cartoonist at all. A Futurist Forain, a Cubist
Raemaekers, are inconceivable because they would be quite useless as
cartoonists, whatever they were as artists.
The artistic value of the cartoons issued in all countries—and in
some cases it is very great—is a matter for future discussion. It is
of no present importance. What is of some actual value is a comparison
between the cartoons of the various countries, for they show with
unfailing accuracy the trend of public opinion. From the human point of
view this comparison is invaluable to the student of humanity in the
present upheaval. From the cheap postcard to the twopenny broadsheet,
from the most commonplace poster to the finest lithograph, each has
its place. To collect these things is not only very interesting, but
most enlightening; the national spirit and the national moods of each
country are unmistakably portrayed, and the crudest production takes
rank with the best as a human document.
III.
THE GOOD cause has always produced the good cartoonist—witness the
Napoleonic wars, when England rejoiced in Gillray and Rowlandson, while
France had no topical draughtsman of any outstanding merit. So far
as one can tell, this is very much the case with the present war. At
any rate, the good cause has produced its good men, and, judging by
what one can manage to see of German caricature, they have no mind of
any large calibre at work on cartoons. This is, perhaps, because the
greater part of the German drawings I have seen are intended to rouse
hatred, scorn, and anger. Clever they certainly are, but too many of
them are spiritually debased. The best are those directed against
England, which are dedicated to hatred, a passion greater than scorn or
anger, and consequently more elevating in its effects. Otherwise the
German cartoonist has not distinguished himself, in the sense that the
war has not raised him above himself.
This can certainly not be said of France, where a crowd of new men have
appeared, and where the well-known draughtsmen of pre-war days have
been roused to unprecedented excellence by their emotions. At least
one of them, M. Forain, has made history with his pencil. There came
a time, when the first excitement had died away, when the victory of
the Marne had for months been followed by stagnation—stagnation in
victory, progress in casualties—a time when no news ever came, when
Paris was left in a kind of twilight of suspense and endurance, when
the economic pinch began to be acutely felt, when bereaved wives and
mothers were told in the morning that their loved ones "were gloriously
dead for their country," and read at night that "there is nothing to
report on the front; the night was calm." And for just a moment the
human need and sorrow of the individual cried louder than the pride
of country. "It's very long, this war!" "What I want to know is, how
much more do they expect us to endure?" "Could defeat be worse than
war?" and even the sinister "if we win," were phrases that crept into
conversation. It was hardly to be wondered at. France had expended so
much energy on her magnificent effort in August, '14, when her very
babies bore themselves proudly and with self-control, that she was
bound to feel the reaction.
It did not last long, and it was Forain who swept it away by a dose
of strong tonic. He drew two French privates in a trench, snow and
hail and shrapnel raining round them, in conditions as bad as the
most anxious mother's nightmare could have pictured them. And one
says: "If only they hold out!" The other, with a look of great
surprise, enquires: "Who?" "Those civilians!" In a week that drawing
was historic, and civilian France, with a blush and a laugh, had
pulled herself together. M. Forain does not care to have his drawings
reproduced, or this famous cartoon would have been included in this
book.
Nor, unfortunately, will M. Jean Véber have his cartoons reproduced
till after the war, which deprives us of that Napoleon of his, standing
on his own tomb and crying "Vive l'Angleterre," which created such a
stir on both sides of the Channel. "La Brûte est Lâchée," by the same
artist, is one of the most impressive drawings France has produced
since the war. Published so early as September, '14, it represents the
Prussian monster, madness and fury in his face, starting out like an
unleashed animal on his career of destruction.
This print was the first to indicate the enormous boom in war-drawings
which has characterized Paris. Published at 5 francs, it was within a
few months unobtainable under 500. Collectors took the hint, and the
drawings of Forain, Steinlen, and other well-known artists were eagerly
sought after, and rose to very high premiums. The character of the
prints changed; with the exception of M. Véber's series, the greater
part of the drawings published outside magazines and newspapers had
been cheap, ranging from threepence to two francs each, and including
some publications of deliberately naïve construction and crude colours,
others which achieved without deliberation a startling likeness to the
old broadsheets with their childlike simplicity. Postcards and prints
fairly flooded Paris in the first few months of the war, but since the
collector appeared on the scene in his dozens the cheaper publications
have been displaced by more ambitious works that range up to a hundred
francs each, and have crowded out the smaller artist, the smaller
print-seller, and the smaller collector.
This variety of output has been increased by the publication of
many illustrated war-papers in Paris, such as _Le Mot_, _l'Europe
Anti-Prussienne_, _l'Anti-Boche_, _A la Baïonnette_, war editions of
already established papers, and a crop of crude halfpenny papers,
printed after the Epinal manner, and greatly used by children and the
very low classes. A coloured history of the war, of extraordinary
naïveté, issued in penny sheets, was intended for use in schools, but
achieved an additional success in hospitals, where the thin sheet was
easily held and folded, and the incidents depicted roused the liveliest
interest among the wounded.
In the whole of this output it is difficult to find any sign of
wavering in the national spirit of France. Once the civilians had
decided to hold out, there could be no other stumbling-block.
Naturally, in such a range of drawings, there are many that drop into
brutality on the one hand, vulgarity on the other; but the overwhelming
majority breathe a spirit of calm, determined endurance, with a ready
laugh for hardships, a sly dig at politicians, and no little irony at
the expense of their own weaknesses and foibles. Very often, so often
as to set the key for the whole, the note is heroic, sometimes grimly
so. There is none of the splenetic fury of the German drawings about
the majority of the French ones; the Germans are ridiculed and hated,
it is true, but the spirit is more steady and less spiteful—it rests
on an emotion which for forty-five years has been a religion to the
Frenchman.
The English cartoons are as different as possible from both the French
and the German. We have no separately published prints, our postcards
have been few, vulgar, and negligible; our cartoonists are really
only offered the pages of newspapers and magazines in which to exert
their influence over us. And there cannot be two questions as to that
influence—it is the influence of good humour. The French mistake it
sometimes for indifference, but the English know better. The Germans
say they mistake it for frivolity, but they so foam at the mouth about
it that one suspects them of glimpsing the spirit behind the smile. The
grim note of Steinlen and Forain is almost wholly wanting from English
cartoons. The Kaiser, who is a devil in France, is merely making an
unholy fool of himself in England; the Crown-Prince, a mass of vice in
Paris, is "an awful silly blighter" in London. Will Dyson, the young
artist of whom Australia has such reason to be proud, is our grimmest
product, and even he lets the Prussian off more easily than do the
French artists. Because, after all, don't you know, we're going to
thrash the brutes, but there's no need to make a fuss about it, hang it
all. Let us have our pipe and our grin, and let us keep to those till
the end. For the Lord's sake don't let us have any heroics—those are
for doing, not for showing. That is the attitude which one finds over
and over again in English drawings; not contempt of danger, so much as
a serene determination to grin at it and have no fuss.
_Punch_ has come out brilliantly in this particular. Allowed by
tradition to have two heroic cartoons a week, the rest of his pages
are dedicated to the god of laughter. Germany reads _Punch_ with
stupefaction. What, we not only laugh at the Germans, we laugh more
at the English! Extraordinary, sinister, effete, degenerate race! It
is true, we laugh at ourselves far more than at anybody else—and
very often it is for that painful but cogent reason, that we may not
weep. Perhaps at the front they laugh wholeheartedly at _Punch_; at
home it is a different laugh that greets Tommy in his imperturbable
good-humour. In the midst of a hell of fire, Tommy says that what with
the beastly Belgian tobacco and the blooming French matches, this'll
be the death of him. Sitting on the edge of a trench which consists of
nothing but mud and water, in a fearful downpour, he remarks that he
pities the poor fellows at home—the London streets must be something
awful! And on a dozen other occasions he has expressed that cheery soul
of his, in a way as charming as it is moving.
As for the Germans, perhaps Mr. Punch reached his happiest moment when
he gave us the German family "enjoying its morning hate." A French
paper copied that with enjoyment tinged with bewilderment, since the
idiomatic "morning hate" was beyond the French editor, who published it
merely as "a study of a German family at breakfast time". The Germans
have not published it at all.
Nothing more light-hearted and good-humoured than Mr. Heath Robinson's
fantastic inventions (such as the Tatcho bomb) could be found—unless
perhaps, in the inimitable "Big and Little Willie" of Mr. Haselden,
which have given pleasure to countless people, at the front and at
home, and have caused howls of Majestätsbeleidigungisch laughter in
German trenches, when Tommy has been so kind as to throw a copy over.
England has never taken cartoons so seriously as has France, nor has
she a public for separate topical prints; but she has done as much as
she can, for her war cartoons accurately express her mind, and that is
their real function and constitutes their real value.
Neutral countries have had to be careful in some ways; it is difficult
to find any interesting war-prints or postcards on sale there. What
there are are rather insipid, at any rate to the Allied mind. But in
individual newspapers and periodicals the struggle has raged fiercely
by pen and pencil, pro-Ally or pro-German. Mr. Robert Carter, for
instance, in his drawings in the _New York Evening Sun_, has spoken
with no uncertain voice, as one of his cartoons in this book will
witness. Spain has had more pro-Ally cartoons than one might have
expected, Scandinavia has been very discreet—Italy never was, even
before she came in.
Holland remains, and well has she shown that she still possesses
that spirit of resistance to the oppressor which dictated the pages
of her superb history. Small in size, in a geographical position of
great danger, her economic interests very largely identified with the
welfare of Germany, Holland might have been excused for holding her
peace. Everyone knew that German influence was, and is, very important
in Holland; that the Netherlands reek with German espionage, and that
method of commercial penetration which is one of Prussia's most valued
weapons. Yet none of these things sufficed to silence the Dutch love of
liberty and hatred of oppression. A band of Dutch cartoonists, hot with
indignation, took the bit between their teeth, and ran away with their
pencils, their papers, their public, and, if their startled Government
is right, very nearly with Dutch neutrality. Anyone who has watched
Dutch drawings must have been impressed by the fire of the pro-Ally
artists, Braakensiek, Albert Hahn, Peter van den Hem, and Lazrom.
Neutrality is too pale for them.
And, of course, there is Louis Raemaekers. Only a neutral could have
done what he has done; but it might not have been done at all had not
Raemaekers arisen with his accusing pencil. In his work the war takes
on its right colour, as something far above international hatreds or
the struggle of policies, far above even a battle for the welfare of
peoples whose interests are opposed. It appears in its right aspect,
as a spiritual conflict, more deadly, more earnest, more vital, than
any revolution or reformation or war since that struggle in which
proud Lucifer fell. This is every man's war, the world's war, the
war of God and devil. And, taking this heroic view of it, Raemaekers
has stepped into the rôle of Tragedy, which is "to arouse pity and
terror, and the noble movements of the soul." His "Prisoners" and
"Barbed Wire" (Plates XXII. and XXIII.) show well his detached, tragic
quality. There are many of his drawings which are too dreadful to be
contemplated for long—"Slow Gas Poisoning," the German thief trampling
in blood that drops from his heavy sack, the professor and the devil
leering delightedly into each other's eyes. But after such horrors
one comes always back to the exquisite tenderness which is the real
distinguishing characteristic of Raemaekers. The young German soldier
who writes home that "our cemeteries now stretch nearly to the sea"
is as tenderly drawn as are the widows of Belgium. The tenderness of
strength is the heart of the tragic spirit, the heart that bleeds for
suffering and weakness, the heart that grows hot for injustice and
wrong. It is this spirit, with its heart of tenderness, that has made
the fame of Raemaekers. It is not comfortable nor pleasant to be roused
to the tragic sentiments, but it is right that we should; and had the
Allies needed any reassurance as to the nature of the reason for which
they fight, Raemaekers' work would have supplied it. The good cause
has found its good artist, and he is all the stronger because he is a
neutral. Like Truth in the cartoon with which this book closes, he has
held up the mirror to the Prussian, and we can see, Germany can see,
the whole world can see, what kind of soul is reflected therein.
ENGLISH CARTOONS
I. The famous cartoon by F. H. Townsend, "Bravo Belgium," fitly
appears as the frontispiece to this book. It is reprinted from _Punch_
by permission of the Proprietors.
II. REHABILITATED!
Germany (to her Professor):
"What if we do not fulfil our promises—the whole world must now
admiringly confess we are men of honour—we fulfil our threats!"
By Will Dyson. First published in _The Nation_, May 15, 1915.
[Illustration: II.]
III. AUDIENCE.
_Prussianism._ "... And Poets, Professors, Instructors of the Young,
let it be Your divine labour to quicken our Germany with a hate of
England so vast, so holy, so unappeasable, that WE need fear no more
the danger of her hating US."
By Will Dyson. First published in _The Nation_, May 8, 1915.
[Illustration: III.]
IV. THE BAFFLED BURGLAR.
_The Burglar_: "I've got the swag, but strafe that copper! I can't get
away with it, and there's no food in that beastly cupboard!"
By "F. C. G." First published in the _Westminster Gazette_, February
11, 1916.

VI. IMPERIALISMUS.
Under this laconic title Mr. E. J. Sullivan shows us a museum specimen
of that extinct monster "The German Eagle."
Reproduced from "The Kaiser's Garland," by permission of Mr. William
Heinemann.
[Illustration: VI.]
VII. Mr. W. Heath Robinson's well-known series entitled "Rejected by
the Inventions Board," is typical of the irresponsible sense of fun
which English People seem able to retain even in war-time. Here we
see an excellent idea put into action: "The Armoured Corn-Crusher for
treading on the Enemy's Toes."
Reproduced from _The Sketch_ of Jan. 5, 1916.
[Illustration: VII.]
A NEW ZEALAND CARTOON
VIII. This is what the _Auckland Observer_ thought of floating mines,
in the first few months of the war. Those were the days before
submarine warfare put even mines in the shade for wanton cruelty and
stupid destructiveness.
[Illustration: VIII.]
ITALIAN CARTOONS
IX. There were few pro-German cartoons in Italy, even before she
came in with the Allies. Now and then her artists took a cynical and
detached attitude towards the awful struggle in the north, but for the
most part their drawings left no doubt as to where their sympathies
lay, as may be judged by this and the two following cartoons. This
first is from the Turin _Numero_. Musini shows the Germans paving the
ruined streets of Flanders with the material most plentifully to hand.
[Illustration: IX.]
X. & XI. In these allegorical sketches, published by _l'Uomo di
Pietra_, of Milan, the artist pictures the results to Europe should
Germany and should the Allies win. Under the Prussian sword and helmet
the whole continent lies burning and bleeding; around the Phrygian cap
of liberty her merry and obviously well-nourished children play over
her prosperous lands, amid commerce-laden seas.
[Illustration: X.]
[Illustration: XI.]
TWO ARGENTINE DRAWINGS
XII. & XIII. The Argentine is a long way off—further than
Washington—and might have been pardoned if she had looked with
detached philosophy upon the deeds of Germany. Her attitude, however,
leaves much to be desired from the point of view of Berlin. Whether as
a rat coveting the good Dutch cheese, or as "the Monster" taking what
he wants from helpless Belgium, the German does not cut a good figure
in the _Critica_, of Buenos-Ayres.
[Illustration: XII.]
[Illustration: XIII.]
AMERICAN CARTOONS
XIV. The neutrality of these three drawings is distinctly open to
question. "The Order of the Iron Cross" is from _Life_, of New York.
[Illustration: XIV.]
XV. "The Hand of God," by Nelson Greene. One of the best known
American cartoons since the war.
From _Puck_, of New York.
[Illustration: XV.]
XVI. Mr. Robert Carter's drawings for the New York _Evening Sun_ have
acquired a reputation in Europe since the war. This is one of the
best, which appeared on January 18, 1916.
The Bear: "Glad to see you out again."
Kaiser: "I feel better myself!"

A JAPANESE CARTOON
XVII. "The Austro-German Alliance," as seen by an artist of the _Jiji
Shimpo_ of Tokio.

DUTCH CARTOONS
XVIII. THE GAME OF CHESS.
"He alone can decide how the game shall end."
(_De Roskam_, of Maëstricht).
[Illustration: XVIII.]
XIX. IN THE SUBMARINE.
[Illustration: XIX.]
XX. "TWENTIETH CENTURY MONUMENTAL STYLE."
Suggestion by M. Albert Hahn, in _De Notenkraker_, of Amsterdam, for
the rebuilding of Rheims Cathedral after the war, in a style more
conformable to Kultur than the Gothic.
[Illustration: XX.]
XXI. "KREUZLAND! KREUZLAND ÜBER ALLES!"
By Louis Raemaekers.
This is the third and last of a powerful series of three drawings
of the sorrows of Belgium—"The Mothers," "The Widows," and "The
Children." This and the three following drawings were among those
which appeared in the Amsterdam _Telegraaf_, and carried the fame
of M. Raemaekers almost instantaneously over the world. They are
reproduced here by permission of the Proprietors of _Land and Water_.
[Illustration: XXI.]
XXII. PRISONERS. "HUNGER AND MISERY."
By Louis Raemaekers.
[Illustration: XXII.]
XXIII. "BARBED WIRE."
By Louis Raemaekers.
Barbed wire figures in both these drawings, widely-different as they
are. It has a special significance, used as a background to two such
contrasting aspects of war.
[Illustration: XXIII.]
XXIV. "OUR FATHER WHICH ART IN HEAVEN."
By Louis Raemaekers.
[Illustration: XXIV.]
TWO RUSSIAN CARTOONS
_from the Petrograd "Loukomorye"_
XXV. Franz Joseph departs to the Front to cheer his Troops. But will
he get there?
[Illustration: XXV.]
XXVI. "THE WEAKLING."
Nobody could congratulate Mother Turk and Father Ferdinand on the
son (Turco-Bulgar Agreement) Doctor Kaiser has just helped into the
world. It would hardly be tactful for the closest friend to hazard a
statement that it favoured either parent.
[Illustration: XXVI.]
A POLISH CARTOONIST
XXVII. M. d'Ostoya, the well-known Polish artist, has published in
Paris, during the war, a very strong series of drawings, both in
colour and in black. Of this series the two shown here are among the
best-contrasted.
Says the Prussian Officer: "Who is it who commands here? You, a simple
little Jew, or I—who have thirteen quarterings of nobility?"
[Illustration:
Gott mit uns!
Qui est-ce qui commande ici, toi qui n'es qu'un
simple petit juif ou moi qui possède treize quartiers de noblesse?
XXVII.]
XXVIII. A DINNER AT HEADQUARTERS.
"A pig's head was also served, ornamented with laurel-leaves—for in
Germany it is customary to crown pigs with laurel."
Heinrich Heine, _Germania_.
[Illustration:
Un diner au Quartier Général
... On servit aussi une tête de porc ornée de feuilles de
laurier, car en Allemagne on a l'habitude de couronner
de laurier le front des cochons
Henri Heine, Germania
XXVIII.]
FRENCH CARTOONS
XXIX. Poulbot is the interpreter of French childhood, and in that
capacity his pencil, before August 1914, had given infinite pleasure.
But pleasure ceased to be a very important pre-occupation in August,
1914, and even Poulbot's sympathetic pencil lent itself to horror as
easily as to mirth.
This drawing appeared in _l'Anti-Boche_, of Paris.
"Don't be frightened, kill her—I've got hold of her," runs the legend.
[Illustration: —N'aie pas peur, tue-la, j'la tiens.
XXIX.]
XXX. When the Zeppelins first came to Paris, public interest was
immense, and children were wakened that they might not miss the sight.
This drawing by Baldo from _l'Anti-Boche_, is not at all exaggerated.
"It looks like a sausage!"
"Oh, no!" cries the child, "if it had been a sausage the Boches would
have eaten it long ago."
[Illustration: XXX.]
XXXI. THE GERMAN ATROCITIES.
This was one of the earliest coloured prints published in Paris during
the war, and formed part of a cheap series, issued at a few sous each,
and printed in colours the most brilliant and most naïve. The little
boy of seven who was shot for levelling his wooden gun in play at the
German invaders was a very favourite theme with all French artists,
from Véber downwards. The incident is alleged to have taken place in
the village of Magny, Alsace.
[Illustration: LES ATROCITÉS ALLEMANDES
LES ALLEMANDS TUENT UN ENFANT DE 7 ANS QUI LES AVAIT MIS EN JOUE AVEC
SON FUSIL DE BOIS
En passant à Magny (Haute-Alsace) des fantassins allemands aperçorvent
un enfant de sept ans qui s'amusait à les mettre en joue avec un fusil
de bois, au canon de fer blanc!... Un feu de salve tiré par les brutes
renversa le pauvre petit qui s'escroula dans une mare de sang!... Il
était mort!... Nous autions souri, les Allemands ont tué.
XXXI.]
XXXII. A drawing by Armengol, from _Le Rire Rouge_, Paris. "Retreat
from the Front" (Le Front se Degarnit).
[Illustration: XXXII.]
XXXIII. IN THE BAGNIO.
By Gallo.
"What did you do?"
"I killed my mother. And you?"
"I was Emperor of Germany."
(Reproduction of a drawing in _A la Baïonnette_, Paris.)
[Illustration: XXXIII.]
XXXIV. THE CONSULTATION ON THE KAISER.
_Dr. George_: It is astonishing how effective are the "75" pills of
Dr. Poincaré.
_Dr. Albert_: Yes, I agree with you; the treatment should be
continued.
[Illustration:
Dr. GEORGE—C'est etonnant comme les pilules 75 du Dr. Poincaré lui
font de l'effect.
Dr. ALBERT—Oui, je suis de votre avis, il faudrait
continuer avec ce traitment.
XXXIV.]
XXXV. "THE SACRED UNION."
By Garcia Benito.
_The Marchioness_: "Dear me—in uniform one can't tell mine from
yours!"
[Illustration: XXXV.]
XXXVI. "THE SILENT ONE"—JOFFRE.
By Leandre, the allegorical cartoonist, in _Le Rire Rouge_, Paris.
The reputation for silence enjoyed by General Joffre is better-founded
than is always the case with the reputed characteristics of great men.
In the course of being shaved at a Paris barber's recently, an English
client was told that General Joffre had for fifteen years been a
regular customer at the shop. "And what sort of person is he really?"
"I don't know, sir—he never said anything!"
[Illustration: XXXVI].
XXXVII. French satire has not devoted itself entirely to our enemies,
but has been frequently turned on France. There are comedy and irony,
perhaps even pathos, in Albert Guillaume's cartoon in_ Le Rire Rouge_
of the fair and probably frail lady who replies to the Sister of
Mercy's request for clothes for the refugees: "Certainly, Sister.
Françoise, bring me my pink dress with silver sequins. Do you mind
it's being slit up at one side, Sister? It does rather date it."
[Illustration: XXXVII.]
XXXVIII. THE SICK MAN'S BURDEN.
The Two-Hunned Camel [Le Chameau à Deux Boches].
From _Le Rire Rouge_.
[Illustration: XXXVIII.]
XXXIX. AT THE GATES OF THE VATICAN.
"Open! Open! It is unhappy Belgium!"
The Pope's neutrality was not popular in France, even before he
refused to pronounce an opinion on the violation of Belgium, as "that
had happened in his predecessor's time." Many people consider that by
this attitude the Vatican lost a priceless opportunity of re-capturing
France. It is significant that this moving cartoon, from _Le Rire
Rouge_, is signed: "A. Willette, Catholique."
[Illustration: XXXIX.]
XL. "The Pope says...."
By Grandjouan (_Le Rire Rouge_).
[Illustration: XL.]
XLI. GOTT MIT UNS.
"What would they have left Him if He had not been with them?"
_Le Rire Rouge._
[Illustration: XLI.]
XLII. & XLIII. Steinlen was once known best for his black cats—thin,
rather wicked cats, prowling and hungry, and with inscrutable thoughts
of their own. His fame grew, his scope widened and deepened, but never
had he probed so deep nor risen so high as he has done since the war
took him from his observation of social traits and concentrated him
on the nobler aspects of mankind—and especially womankind. These two
drawings are from a series which they worthily represent: "National
Aid" and "Glory."
[Illustration: XLII.]
[Illustration: XLIII.]
XLIV. KAISER BONNOT, by H. A. Ibels.
The war has not obliterated so completely the life that went before
it, that we have forgotten the Motor Bandits, headed by Bonnot, who
terrorised Paris by their audacity for many weeks. Had this drawing
not been a likeness of the Kaiser it would still have been a wonderful
delineation of the apache, his reckless soul showing through every
inch of his stealthy body.
[Illustration: XLIV.
Kaiser - Bonnot
XLIV.]
XLV. DAVID AND GOLIATH, by Paul Iribe.
This drawing formed the cover of the first number of _Le Mot_, a
short-lived but most interesting penny paper published in Paris during
the war.
[Illustration: XLV. David et Goliath]
XLVI. THE FAILURE, by Sem.
"After the Battle of the Marne, more than 50,000 German corpses were
counted"—(The Papers).
_Le Mot._
[Illustration: LE RATÉ.
après la bataille de la Marne on a compté plus de
80.000 cadavres allemands...
(LES JOURNAUX).
XLVI.]
(A Franco-Russian Drawing.)
XLVII. This drawing by Bakst, which appeared in _Le Mot_, bears the
following legend:
"Leon Bakst, the great Russian painter, promises very soon, he says:
From the Carpathians to Berlin a bound in the style of the Russian
ballets, to the great stupefaction of those hounds of Germans and
Austrians."
[Illustration:
_Leon Bakst, le grand peintre russe, nous promet pour
bientôt, dit-il: "Des Karpathes a Berlin, un bond dans le style des
Ballets Russes, a la grande stupeur de ces chiens d'Allemands et
d'Autrichiens."_
XLVII.]
XLVIII. The Empress Eugènie has turned her house into a military
hospital.
"Do you know where we are, Jimmy?"
"The nurse told me that it's the house of a lady who has lost her son
in the war."
From _Le Mot_.
[Illustration: L'IMPERATRICE EUGENIE A TRANSFORME SA RESIDENCE DE
FARNBOROUGH HILL EN HOPITAL MILITAIRE.
—Savez-vous chez qui nous sommes Jimmy?
—La nurse m'a dit que c'était chez une dame qui a perdu son fils à la
guerre.

XLIX. THE HOSTAGES, by A. Hermann-Paul.
From a woodcut published by the
Librarie de l'Estampe,
68 Chaussée d'Antin, Paris.
[Illustration: XLIX.]
FOUR POSTCARDS
L. A Japanese postcard, on the resistance of Belgium to Germany. This
is a characteristic production, with the legend in Japanese, and was
not published for the Western market. The English names and number
were written on it by the purchaser in Japan.
[Illustration: L.]
LI. This spirited and delightful postcard by Niké, one of a series
which foreran his book of soldiers (almost the only wholesome war-book
for children), was published as early as August, 1914, before the
victory of the Marne. Looking at its breezy outlines, and at the
merry colours of the original, it is difficult to believe that it was
drawn and printed at a time when all the printers were mobilised, and
makeshift workmen formed the only labour.
[Illustration:
the Cosack:... Can I give you a lift to Berlin?...
Le Cosaque:... Viens-tu á Berlin?......

LII. THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE.
"In a magnificent rush the German armies have _twice_ passed the
Marne. All goes well. The troops are fresh."—_Wolff._
Collection of 6 cards of the firm Bouveret, Le Mans.

GERMAN CARTOONS
It is not easy to come by copies of the German papers, as the
Trade-with-the-Enemy Act frowns upon such commerce. Happily, there
are neutral countries, through whose agency something may be done.
This and the following six pages are devoted to German Cartoons, from
_Simplicissimus_, the famous Munich illustrated paper. They are very
clever, very mordant, very amusing, and always at their best when
directed against England.
LIV. THE LUSITANIA.
"Isn't it madness, to take so many women and children in a munition
transport?"
"On the contrary; by this means, when the ship goes to the devil, the
world will be raging against Germany."
And it was!
[Illustration: LIV.]
LV. EARNEST TIMES IN WINDSOR CASTLE.
"To the noisy applause of the Salvation Army, King George banishes the
Devil Alcohol."
The castle is not very life-like, but the bottle is—the free
advertisement should be worth something, even in war-time.
[Illustration: LV.]
LVI. D'Annunzio: "At any rate, I am sure of being immortal in the
heart of my creditors."
[Illustration: LVI.]
LVII. WHEN BUDDHA WAKES.
This is a typical example of the view taken of the British soldier
by the German artist—that he is extremely long, extremely thin, and
extremely ugly. He is not here, however, smoking the usual pipe.
[Illustration: LVII.]
LVIII. APACHES IN THE TRENCHES.
"Paris without light and without police! That does make a man
homesick!"
[Illustration: LVIII.]
LIX. THE MOOD IN FRANCE.
_(a)_ Behind the German lines.
_(b)_ Behind the French lines.
[Illustration: LIX.]
LX. THE MOOD IN FLANDERS.
"Is that an enemy aeroplane, Madeleine?"
"No, Fritz; it isn't an enemy, its a German!"
[Illustration: LX.]
LXI. A ZEPPELIN OVER TRAFALGAR SQUARE.
Free advertisement appears again here—Otherwise, the cab-horse and
King Charles are the striking features.
[Illustration: LXI.]
LXII. SONNINO AND SALANDRA.
"Now we've got the money, Herr Colleague, you can summon the Italian
people to its great historical mission."
[Illustration: LXII.]
LXIII. KITCHENER AND FRANCE'S RECRUITS.
"Only have patience, boys, and you shall yet fight for England. We
will keep the war on long enough for that."
[Illustration: LXIII.]
LXIV. BRITANNIA THE HOUSEKEEPER, TO THE FLEET:
"I must dust you nicely every week, so that you may be as good as new
when peace is concluded."
[Illustration: LXIV.]
LXV. THE POOR LARK.
"I give it up, trying to sing against the guns! I'm completely hoarse
already."
[Illustration: LXV.]
LXVI. ENGLISH TACTICS.
"Only two Dreadnoughts against one small cruiser—it will take a lot
to make the English attack!"
[Illustration: LXVI.]
LXVII. LORD KITCHENER DISTORTS THE EVIDENCE.
"This man says that the Germans treat their wounded prisoners well.
But you see, Sir, that they have tortured him so terribly that he has
lost his senses."
Better caricatures than these one could not ask to see. Tommy comes
off worse than anyone else, and even for him his ear and his breeches
have been rendered characteristically.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Dedication
To the Right Honourable and Mighty Lord, THOMAS EARLE OF SUSSEX,
Viscount Fitzwalter, Lord of Egremont and of Burnell, Knight of the
most noble Order of the Garter, Iustice of the forrests and Chases from
Trent Southward; Captain of the Gentleman Pensioners of the House of
the QUEENE our Soveraigne Lady.
After that I had taken upon me (right Honourable) in manner of that
unlearned and foolish Poet, Cherillus, who rashly and unadvisedly
wrought a big volume in verses, of the valiant prowesse of Alexander
the Great, to translate this present booke, contayning the
Metamorphosis of Lucius Apuleius; being mooved thereunto by the right
pleasant pastime and delectable matter therein; I eftsoones consulted
with myself, to whom I might best offer so pleasant and worthy a work,
devised by the author, it being now barbarously and simply framed in
our English tongue. And after long deliberation had, your honourable
lordship came to my remembrance, a man much more worthy, than to whom
so homely and rude a translation should be presented. But when I again
remembred the jesting and sportfull matter of the booke, unfit to be
offered to any man of gravity and wisdome, I was wholly determined to
make no Epistle Dedicatory at all; till as now of late perswaded
thereunto by my friends, I have boldly enterprised to offer the same to
your Lordship, who as I trust wil accept the same, than if it did
entreat of some serious and lofty matter, light and merry, yet the
effect thereof tendeth to a good and vertuous moral, as in the
following Epistle to the reader may be declared. For so have all
writers in times past employed their travell and labours, that their
posterity might receive some fruitfull profit by the same. And therfore
the poets feined not their fables in vain, considering that children in
time of their first studies, are very much allured thereby to proceed
to more grave and deepe studies and disciplines, whereas their mindes
would quickly loath the wise and prudent workes of learned men, wherein
in such unripe years they take no spark of delectation at all. And not
only that profit ariseth to children by such feined fables, but also
the vertues of men are covertly thereby commended, and their vices
discommended and abhorred. For by the fable of Actaeon, where it is
feigned that he saw Diana washing her selfe in a well, hee was
immediately turned into an Hart, and so was slain of his own Dogs; may
bee meant, That when a man casteth his eyes on the vain and soone
fading beauty of the world, consenting thereto in his minde, hee
seemeth to bee turned into a brute beast, and so to be slain by the
inordinate desire of his owne affects. By Tantalus that stands in the
midst of the floud Eridan, having before him a tree laden with pleasant
apples, he being neverthelesse always thirsty and hungry, betokeneth
the insatiable desires of covetous persons. The fables of Atreus,
Thiestes, Tereus and Progne signifieth the wicked and abhominable facts
wrought and attempted by mortall men. The fall of Icarus is an example
to proud and arrogant persons, that weeneth to climb up to the heavens.
By Mydas, who obtained of Bacchus, that all things which he touched
might be gold, is carped the foul sin of avarice. By Phaeton, that
unskilfully took in hand to rule the chariot of the Sunne, are
represented those persons which attempt things passing their power and
capacity. By Castor and Pollux, turned into a signe in heaven called
Gemini, is signified, that vertuous and godly persons shall be rewarded
after life with perpetuall blisse. And in this feined jest of Lucius
Apuleius is comprehended a figure of mans life, ministring most sweet
and delectable matter, to such as shall be desirous to reade the same.
The which if your honourable lordship shall accept and take in good
part, I shall not onely thinke my small travell and labour well
employed, but also receive a further comfort to attempt some more
serious matter, which may be more acceptable to your Lordship: desiring
the same to excuse my rash and bold enterprise at this time, as I
nothing doubt of your Lordships goodnesse. To whome I beseech Almighty
God to impart long life, with encrease of much honour.
From Vniversity Colledge in Oxenforde, the xviij. of September, 1566.
Your Honours most bounden,
WIL. ADLINGTON.
The Life of Lucius Apuleius Briefly Described
LUCIUS APULEIUS African, an excellent follower of Plato his sect, born
in Madaura, a Countrey sometime inhabited by the Romans, and under the
jurisdiction of Syphax, scituate and lying on the borders of Numidia
and Getulia, whereby he calleth himself half a Numidian and half a
Getulian: and Sidonius named him the Platonian Madaurence: his father
called Theseus had passed all offices of dignity in his countrey with
much honour. His mother named Salvia was of such excellent vertue, that
she passed all the Dames of her time, borne of an ancient house, and
descended from the philosopher Plutarch, and Sextus his nephew. His
wife called Prudentila was endowed with as much vertue and riches as
any woman might be. Hee himselfe was of an high and comely stature,
gray eyed, his haire yellow, and a beautiful personage. He flourished
in Carthage in the time of Iolianus Avitus and Cl. Maximus Proconsuls,
where he spent his youth in learning the liberall sciences, and much
profited under his masters there, whereby not without cause hee calleth
himself the Nource of Carthage, and the celestial Muse and venerable
mistresse of Africke. Soone after, at Athens (where in times past the
well of all doctrine flourished) he tasted many of the cups of the
muses, he learned the Poetry, Geometry, Musicke, Logicke, and the
universall knowledge of Philosophy, and studied not in vaine the nine
Muses, that is to say, the nine noble and royal disciplines.
Immediately after he went to Rome, and studied there the Latine tongue,
with such labour and continuall study, that he achieved to great
eloquence, and was known and approved to be excellently learned,
whereby he might worthily be called Polyhistor, that is to say, one
that knoweth much or many things.
And being thus no lesse endued with eloquence, than with singular
learning, he wrote many books for them that should come after: whereof
part by negligence of times be now intercepted and part now extant, doe
sufficiently declare, with how much wisdome and doctrine hee
flourished, and with how much vertue hee excelled amongst the rude and
barbarous people. The like was Anacharsis amongst the most luskish
Scythes. But amongst the Bookes of Lucius Apuleius, which are perished
and prevented, howbeit greatly desired as now adayes, one was intituled
Banquetting questions, another entreating of the nature of fish,
another of the generation of beasts, another containing his Epigrams,
another called “Hermagoras”: but such as are now extant are the foure
books named “Floridorum”, wherein is contained a flourishing stile, and
a savory kind of learning, which delighteth, holdeth, and rejoiceth the
reader marvellously; wherein you shall find a great variety of things,
as leaping one from another: One excellent and copious Oration,
containing all the grace and vertue of the art Oratory, where he
cleareth himself of the crime of art Magick, which was slanderously
objected against him by his Adversaries, wherein is contained such
force of eloquence and doctrine, as he seemeth to passe and excell
himselfe. There is another booke of the god of the spirit of Socrates,
whereof St. Augustine maketh mention in his booke of the definition of
spirits, and description of men. Two other books of the opinion of
Plato, wherein is briefly contained that which before was largely
expressed. One booke of Cosmography, comprising many things of
Aristotles Meteors. The Dialogue of Trismegistus, translated by him out
of Greeke into Latine, so fine, that it rather seemeth with more
eloquence turned into Latine, than it was before written in Greeke. But
principally these eleven Bookes of the “Golden Asse”, are enriched with
such pleasant matter, with such excellency and variety of flourishing
tales, that nothing may be more sweet and delectable, whereby worthily
they may be intituled The Bookes of the “Golden Asse”, for the passing
stile and matter therein. For what can be more acceptable than this
Asse of Gold indeed. Howbeit there be many who would rather intitule it
“Metamorphosis”, that is to say, a transfiguration or transformation,
by reason of the argument and matter within.
The Preface of the Author To His Sonne, Faustinus
And unto the Readers of this Book
That I to thee some joyous jests
may show in gentle gloze,
And frankly feed thy bended eares
with passing pleasant prose:
So that thou daine in seemly sort
this wanton booke to view,
That is set out and garnisht fine,
with written phrases new.
I will declare how one by hap
his humane figure lost,
And how in brutish formed shape,
his loathed life he tost.
And how he was in course of time
from such a state unfold,
Who eftsoone turn’d to pristine shape
his lot unlucky told.
What and who he was attend a while, and you shall understand that it
was even I, the writer of mine own Metamorphosie and strange alteration
of figure. Hymettus, Athens, Isthmia, Ephire Tenaros, and Sparta, being
fat and fertile soiles (as I pray you give credit to the bookes of more
everlasting fame) be places where myne antient progeny and linage did
sometime flourish: there I say, in Athens, when I was yong, I went
first to schoole. Soone after (as a stranger) I arrived at Rome,
whereas by great industry, and without instruction of any schoolmaster,
I attained to the full perfection of the Latine tongue. Behold, I first
crave and beg your pardon, lest I should happen to displease or offend
any of you by the rude and rusticke utterance of this strange and
forrein language. And verily this new alteration of speech doth
correspond to the enterprised matter whereof I purpose to entreat, I
will set forth unto you a pleasant Grecian feast. Whereunto gentle
Reader if thou wilt give attendant eare, it will minister unto thee
such delectable matter as thou shalt be contented withall.
THE FIRST BOOKE
THE FIRST CHAPTER
How Apuleius riding in Thessaly, fortuned to fall into company with two
strangers, that reasoned together of the mighty power of Witches.
As I fortuned to take my voyage into Thessaly, about certaine affaires
which I had to doe (for there myne auncestry by my mothers side
inhabiteth, descended of the line of that most excellent person
Plutarch, and of Sextus the Philosopher his Nephew, which is to us a
great honour) and after that by much travell and great paine I had
passed over the high mountaines and slipperie vallies, and had ridden
through the cloggy fallowed fields; perceiving that my horse did wax
somewhat slow, and to the intent likewise that I might repose and
strengthen my self (being weary with riding) I lighted off my horse,
and wiping the sweat from every part of his body, I unbrideled him, and
walked him softly in my hand, to the end he might pisse, and ease
himself of his weariness and travell: and while he went grazing freshly
in the field (casting his head sometimes aside, as a token of rejoycing
and gladnesse) I perceived a little before me two companions riding,
and so I overtaking them made a third. And while I listened to heare
their communication, the one of them laughed and mocked his fellow,
saying, Leave off I pray thee and speak no more, for I cannot abide to
heare thee tell such absurd and incredible lies; which when I heard, I
desired to heare some newes, and said, I pray you masters make me
partaker of your talk, that am not so curious as desirous to know all
your communication: so shall we shorten our journey, and easily passe
this high hill before us, by merry and pleasant talke.
But he that laughed before at his fellow, said againe, Verily this tale
is as true, as if a man would say that by sorcery and inchantment the
floods might be inforced to run against their course, the seas to be
immovable, the aire to lacke the blowing of windes, the Sunne to be
restrained from his naturall race, the Moone to purge his skimme upon
herbes and trees to serve for sorceries: the starres to be pulled from
heaven, the day to be darkened and the dark night to continue still.
Then I being more desirous to heare his talke than his companions,
sayd, I pray you, that began to tell your tale even now, leave not off
so, but tell the residue. And turning to the other I sayd, You
perhappes that are of an obstinate minde and grosse eares, mocke and
contemme those things which are reported for truth, know you not that
it is accounted untrue by the depraved opinion of men, which either is
rarely seene, seldome heard, or passeth the capacitie of mans reason,
which if it be more narrowly scanned, you shall not onely finde it
evident and plaine, but also very easy to be brought to passe.
THE SECOND CHAPTER
How Apuleius told to the strangers, what he saw a jugler do in Athens.
The other night being at supper with a sort of hungry fellowes, while I
did greedily put a great morsel of meate in my mouth, that was fried
with the flower of cheese and barley, it cleaved so fast in the passage
of my throat and stopped my winde in such sort that I was well nigh
choked. And yet at Athens before the porch there called Peale, I saw
with these eyes a jugler that swallowed up a two hand sword, with a
very keene edge, and by and by for a little money that we who looked on
gave him, hee devoured a chasing speare with the point downeward. And
after that hee had conveyed the whole speare within the closure of his
body, and brought it out againe behind, there appeared on the top
thereof (which caused us all to marvell) a faire boy pleasant and
nimble, winding and turning himself in such sort, that you would
suppose he had neither bone nor gristle, and verily thinke that he were
the naturall Serpent, creeping and sliding on the knotted staffe, which
the god of Medicine is feigned to beare. But turning me to him that
began his tale, I pray you (quoth I) follow your purpose, and I alone
will give credit unto you, and for your paynes will pay your charges at
the next Inne we come unto. To whom he answered Certes sir I thank you
for your gentle offer, and at your request I wil proceed in my tale,
but first I will sweare unto you by the light of this Sunne that
shineth here, that those things shall be true, least when you come to
the next city called Thessaly, you should doubt any thing of that which
is rife in the mouthes of every person, and done before the face of all
men. And that I may first make relation to you, what and who I am, and
whither I go, and for what purpose, know you that I am of Egin,
travelling these countries about from Thessaly to Etolia, and from
Etolia to Boetia, to provide for honey, cheese, and other victuals to
sell againe: and understanding that at Hippata (which is the principall
city of all Thessaly), is accustomed to be soulde new cheeses of
exceeding good taste and relish, I fortuned on a day to go thither, to
make my market there: but as it often happeneth, I came in an evill
houre; for one Lupus a purveyor had bought and ingrossed up all the day
before, and so I was deceived.
Wherefore towards night being very weary, I went to the Baines to
refresh my selfe, and behold, I fortuned to espy my companion Socrates
sitting upon the ground, covered with a torn and course mantle; who was
so meigre and of so sallow and miserable a countenance, that I scantly
knew him: for fortune had brought him into such estate and calamity,
that he verily seemed as a common begger that standeth in the streets
to crave the benevolence of the passers by. Towards whom (howbeit he
was my singular friend and familiar acquaintance, yet half in despaire)
I drew nigh and said, Alas my Socrates, what meaneth this? how faireth
it with thee? What crime hast thou committed? verily there is great
lamentation and weeping for thee at home: Thy children are in ward by
decree of the Provinciall Judge: Thy wife (having ended her mourning
time in lamentable wise, with face and visage blubbered with teares, in
such sort that she hath well nigh wept out both her eyes) is
constrained by her parents to put out of remembrance the unfortunate
losse and lacke of thee at home, and against her will to take a new
husband. And dost thou live here as a ghost or hogge, to our great
shame and ignominy?
Then he answered he to me and said, O my friend Aristomenus, now
perceive I well that you are ignorant of the whirling changes, the
unstable forces, and slippery inconstancy of Fortune: and therewithall
he covered his face (even then blushing for very shame) with his rugged
mantle insomuch that from his navel downwards he appeared all naked.
But I not willing to see him any longer in such great miserie and
calamitie, took him by the hand and lifted him up from the ground: who
having his face covered in such sort, Let Fortune (quoth he) triumph
yet more, let her have her sway, and finish that which shee hath begun.
And therewithall I put off one of my garments and covered him, and
immediately I brought him to the Baine, and caused him to be anointed,
wiped, and the filthy scurfe of his body to be rubbed away; which done,
though I were very weary my selfe, yet I led the poore miser to my
Inne, where he reposed his body upon a bed, and then I brought him meat
and drinke, and so wee talked together: for there we might be merry and
laugh at our pleasure, and so we were, untill such time as he (fetching
a pittifull sigh from the bottom of his heart, and beating his face in
miserable sort), began to say.
THE THIRD CHAPTER
How Socrates in his returne from Macedony to Larissa was spoyled and
robbed, and how he fell acquainted with one Meroe a Witch.
Alas poore miser that I am, that for the onely desire to see a game of
triall of weapons, am fallen into these miseries and wretched snares of
misfortune. For in my returne from Macedonie, wheras I sould all my
wares, and played the Merchant by the space of ten months, a little
before that I came to Larissa, I turned out of the way, to view the
scituation of the countrey there, and behold in the bottom of a deep
valley I was suddenly environed with a company of theeves, who robbed
and spoiled me of such things as I had, and yet would hardly suffer me
to escape. But I beeing in such extremity, in the end was happily
delivered from their hands, and so I fortuned to come to the house of
an old woman that sold wine, called Meroe, who had her tongue
sufficiently instructed to flattery: unto whom I opened the causes of
my long peregrination and careful travell, and of myne unlucky
adventure: and after that I had declared to her such things as then
presently came to my remembrance, shee gently entertained mee and made
mee good cheere; and by and by being pricked with carnall desire, shee
brought me to her own bed chamber; whereas I poore miser the very first
night of our lying together did purchase to my selfe this miserable
face, and for her lodging I gave to her such apparel as the theeves
left to cover me withall.
Then I understanding the cause of his miserable estate, sayd unto him,
In faith thou art worthy to sustaine the most extreame misery and
calamity, which hast defiled and maculated thyne owne body, forsaken
thy wife traitorously, and dishonoured thy children, parents, and
friends, for the love of a vile harlot and old strumpet. When Socrates
heard mee raile against Meroe in such sort, he held up his finger to
mee, and as halfe abashed sayd, Peace peace I pray you, and looking
about lest any body should heare, I pray you (quoth he) I pray you take
heed what you say against so venerable a woman as shee is, lest by your
intemperate tongue you catch some harm. Then with resemblance of
admiration, What (quoth I) is she so excellent a person as you name her
to be? I pray you tell me. Then answered hee, Verily shee is a
Magitian, which hath power to rule the heavens, to bringe downe the
sky, to beare up the earth, to turne the waters into hills and the
hills into running waters, to lift up the terrestrial spirits into the
aire, and to pull the gods out of the heavens, to extinguish the
planets, and to lighten the deepe darknesse of hell. Then sayd I unto
Socrates, Leave off this high and mysticall kinde of talke, and tell
the matter in a more plaine and simple fashion. Then answered he, Will
you hear one or two, or more of her facts which she hath done, for
whereas she enforceth not onely the inhabitants of the countrey here,
but also the Indians and the Ethiopians the one and the other, and also
the Antictons, to love her in most raging sort, such as are but trifles
and chips of her occupation, but I pray you give eare, and I will
declare of more greater matters, which shee hath done openly and before
the face of all men.
THE FOURTH CHAPTER
How Meroe the Witch turned divers persons into miserable beasts.
In faith Aristomenus to tell you the truth, this woman had a certaine
Lover, whom by the utterance of one only word she turned into a Bever,
because he loved another woman beside her: and the reason why she
transformed him into such a beast is, for that it is his nature, when
hee perceiveth the hunters and hounds to draw after him, to bite off
his members, and lay them in the way, that the hounds may be at a stop
when they find them, and to the intent it might so happen unto him (for
that he fancied another woman) she turned him into that kind of shape.
Semblably she changed one of her neighbours, being an old man and one
that sold wine, into a Frog, in that he was one of her occupation, and
therefore she bare him a grudge, and now the poore miser swimming in
one of his pipes of wine, and well nigh drowned in the dregs, doth cry
and call with an hoarse voice, for his old guests and acquaintance that
pass by. Like wise she turned one of the Advocates of the Court
(because he pleaded and spake against her in a rightful cause) into a
horned Ram, and now the poore Ram is become an Advocate. Moreover she
caused, that the wife of a certain lover that she had should never be
delivered of her childe, but according to the computation of all men,
it is eight yeares past since the poore woman first began to swell, and
now shee is encreased so big, that shee seemeth as though she would
bring forth some great Elephant: which when it was knowne abroad, and
published throughout all the towne, they tooke indignation against her,
and ordayned that the next day shee should most cruelly be stoned to
death. Which purpose of theirs she prevented by the vertue of her
inchantments, and as Medea (who obtained of King Creon but one days
respit before her departure) did burn all his house, him, and his
daughter: so she, by her conjurations and invocations of spirits,
(which she useth in a certaine hole in her house, as shee her selfe
declared unto me the next day following) closed all the persons in the
towne so sure in their houses, and with such violence of power, that
for the space of two dayes they could not get forth, nor open their
gates nor doore, nor break downe their walls, whereby they were
inforced by mutuall consent to cry unto her, and to bind themselves
strictly by oaths, that they would never afterwards molest or hurt her:
and moreover, if any did offer her any injury they would be ready to
defend her. Whereupon shee, mooved by their promises, and stirred by
pitty, released all the towne. But shee conveyed the principal Author
of this ordinance about midnight, with all his house, the walls, the
ground, and the foundation, into another towne, distant from thence an
hundred miles, scituate and beeing on the top of an high hill, and by
reason thereof destitute of water, and because the edifices and houses
were so nigh built together, that it was not possible for the house to
stand there, she threw it downe before the gate of the towne. Then I
spake and said O my friend Socrates you have declared unto me many
marvellous things and strange chances, and moreover stricken me with no
small trouble of minde, yea rather with great feare, lest the same old
woman using the like practice, should fortune to heare all our
communication. Wherefore let us now sleepe, and after that we have
taken our rest, let us rise betimes in the morning, and ride away hence
before day, as far as we can possible.
THE FIFTH CHAPTER
How Socrates and Aristomenus slept together in one Chamber, and how
they were handled by Witches.
In speaking these words, and devising with my selfe of our departing
the next morrow, lest Meroe the witch should play by us as she had done
by divers other persons, it fortuned that Socrates did fall asleepe,
and slept very soundly, by reason of his travell and plenty of meat and
wine wherewithall hee had filled him selfe. Wherefore I closed and
barred fast the doores of the chamber, and put my bed behinde the
doore, and so layed mee downe to rest. But I could in no wise sleepe,
for the great feare which was in my heart, untill it was about
midnight, and then I began to slumber. But alas, behold suddenly the
chamber doores brake open, and locks, bolts, and posts fell downe, that
you would verily have thought that some Theeves had been presently come
to have spoyled and robbed us. And my bed whereon I lay being a truckle
bed, fashioned in forme of a Cradle, and one of the feet broken and
rotten, by violence was turned upside downe, and I likewise was
overwhelmed and covered lying in the same. Then perceived I in my
selfe, that certaine affects of the minde by nature doth chance
contrary. For as teares oftentimes trickle downe the cheekes of him
that seeth or heareth some joyfull newes, so I being in this fearfull
perplexity, could not forbeare laughing, to see how of Aristomenus I
was made like unto a snail [in] his shell. And while I lay on the
ground covered in this sort, I peeped under the bed to see what would
happen. And behold there entred in two old women, the one bearing a
burning torch, and the other a sponge and a naked sword; and so in this
habit they stood about Socrates being fast asleep. Then shee which bare
the sword sayd unto the other, Behold sister Panthia, this is my deare
and sweet heart, which both day and night hath abused my wanton
youthfulnesse. This is he, who little regarding my love, doth not only
defame me with reproachfull words, but also intendeth to run away. And
I shall be forsaken by like craft as Vlysses did use, and shall
continually bewaile my solitarinesse as Calipso. Which said, shee
pointed towards mee that lay under the bed, and shewed me to Panthia.
This is hee, quoth she, which is his Counsellor, and perswadeth him to
forsake me, and now being at the point of death he lieth prostrate on
the ground covered with his bed, and hath seene all our doings, and
hopeth to escape scot-free from my hands, but I will cause that hee
will repente himselfe too late, nay rather forthwith, of his former
intemperate language, and his present curiosity. Which words when I
heard I fell into a cold sweat, and my heart trembled with feare,
insomuch that the bed over me did likewise rattle and shake. Then spake
Panthia unto Meroe and said, Sister let us by and by teare him in
pieces or tye him by the members, and so cut them off. Then Meroe
(being so named because she was a Taverner, and loved wel good wines)
answered, Nay rather let him live, and bury the corpse of this poore
wretch in some hole of the earth; and therewithall shee turned the head
of Socrates on the other side and thrust her sword up to the hilts into
the left part of his necke, and received the bloud that gushed out,
into a pot, that no drop thereof fell beside: which things I saw with
mine own eyes, and as I thinke to the intent that she might alter
nothing that pertained to sacrifice, which she accustomed to make, she
thrust her hand down into the intrals of his body, and searching about,
at length brought forth the heart of my miserable companion Socrates,
who having his throat cut in such sort, yeelded out a dolefull cry, and
gave up the ghost. Then Panthia stopped up the wide wound of his throat
with the Sponge and said, O sponge sprung and made of the sea, beware
that thou not passe by running river. This being said, one of them
moved and turned up my bed, and then they strid over mee, and clapped
their buttocks upon my face, and all bepissed mee until I was wringing
wet. When this was over they went their wayes, and the doores closed
fast, the posts stood in their old places, and the lockes and bolts
were shut againe. But I that lay upon the ground like one without
soule, naked and cold, and wringing wet with pisse, like to one that
were more than half dead, yet reviving my selfe, and appointed as I
thought for the Gallowes, began to say Alasse what shall become of me
to morrow, when my companion shall be found murthered here in the
chamber? To whom shall I seeme to tell any similitude of truth, when as
I shall tell the trueth in deed? They will say, If thou wert unable to
resist the violence of the women, yet shouldest thou have cried for
help; Wouldst thou suffer the man to be slaine before thy face and say
nothing? Or why did they not slay thee likewise? Why did they spare
thee that stood by and saw them commit that horrible fact? Wherefore
although thou hast escaped their hands, yet thou shalt not escape ours.
While I pondered these things with my selfe the night passed on, and so
I resolved to take my horse before day, and goe forward on my journey.
Howbeit the wayes were unknown to me, and thereupon I tooke up my
packet, unlocked and unbarred the doors, but those good and faithfull
doores which in the night did open of their owne accord, could then
scantly be opened with their keyes. And when I was out I cried, O
sirrah Hostler where art thou? Open the stable doore for I will ride
away by and by. The Hostler lying behinde the stable doore upon a
pallet, and half asleepe, What (quoth hee) doe you not know that the
wayes be very dangerous? What meane you to rise at this time of night?
If you perhaps guilty of some heynous crime, be weary of your life, yet
thinke you not that we are such Sots that we will die for you. Then
said I, It is well nigh day, and moreover, what can theeves take from
him that hath nothing? Doest thou not know (Foole as thou art) if thou
be naked, if ten Gyants should assaile thee, they could not spoyle or
rob thee? Whereunto the drowsie Hostler half asleepe, and turning on
the other side, answered, What know I whether you have murthered your
Companion whom you brought in yesternight, or no, and now seeke the
means to escape away? O Lord, at that time I remember the earth seemed
ready to open, and me thought I saw at hell gate the Dog Cerberus ready
to devour mee, and then I verily beleeved, that Meroe did not spare my
throat, mooved with pitty, but rather cruelly pardoned mee to bring mee
to the Gallowes. Wherefore I returned to my chamber, and there devised
with my selfe in what sort I should finish my life. But when I saw that
fortune should minister unto mee no other instrument than that which my
bed profered me, I said, O bed, O bed, most dear to me at this present,
which hast abode and suffered with me so many miseries, judge and
arbiter of such things as were done here this night, whome onely I may
call to witnesse for my innocency, render (I say) unto me some
wholesome weapon to end my life, that am most willing to dye. And
therewithal I pulled out a piece of the rope wherewith the bed was
corded, and tyed one end thereof about a rafter by the window, and with
the other end I made a sliding knot, and stood upon my bed, and so put
my neck into it, and leaped from the bed, thinking to strangle my selfe
and so dye, behold the rope beeing old and rotten burst in the middle,
and I fell down tumbling upon Socrates that lay under: And even at that
same very time the Hostler came in crying with a loud voyce, and sayd,
Where are you that made such hast at midnight, and now lies wallowing
abed? Whereupon (I know not whether it was by my fall, or by the great
cry of the Hostler) Socrates as waking out of sleepe, did rise up first
and sayd, It is not without cause that strangers do speake evill of all
such Hostlers, for this Catife in his comming in, and with his crying
out, I thinke under a colour to steale away something, hath waked me
out of a sound sleepe. Then I rose up joyfull with a merry countenance,
saying, Behold good Hostler, my friend, my companion and my brother,
whom thou didst falsly affirme to be slaine by mee this might. And
therewithall I embraced my friend Socrates and kissed him: but hee
smelling the stinke of the pisse wherewith those Hagges had embrued me,
thrust me away and sayd, Clense thy selfe from this filthy odour, and
then he began gently to enquire, how that noysome sent hapned unto mee.
But I finely feigning and colouring the matter for the time, did breake
off his talk, and tooke him by the hand and sayd, Why tarry we? Why
lose wee the pleasure of this faire morning? Let us goe, and so I tooke
up my packet, and payed the charges of the house and departed: and we
had not gone a mile out of the Towne but it was broad day, and then I
diligently looked upon Socrates throat, to see if I could espy the
place where Meroe thrust in her sword: but when I could not perceive
any such thing, I thought with my selfe, What a mad man am I, that
being overcome with wine yester night, have dreamed such terrible
things? Behold I see Socrates is sound, safe and in health. Where is
his wound? Where is the Sponge? Where is his great and new cut? And
then I spake to him and said, Verily it is not without occasion, that
Physitians of experience do affirme, That such as fill their gorges
abundantly with meat and drinke, shall dreame of dire and horrible
sights: for I my selfe, not tempering my appetite yester night from the
pots of wine, did seeme to see this night strange and cruel visions,
that even yet I think my self sprinkled and wet with human blood:
whereunto Socrates laughing made answer and said, Nay, thou art not wet
with the blood of men, but art embrued with stinking pisse; and verily
I dreamed that my throat was cut, and that I felt the paine of the
wound, and that my heart was pulled out of my belly, and the
remembrance thereof makes me now to feare, for my knees do so tremble
that I can scarce goe any further, and therefore I would faine eat
somewhat to strengthen and revive my spirits. Then said I, behold here
thy breakefast, and therewithall I opened my script that hanged upon my
shoulder, and gave him bread and cheese, and we sate downe under a
greate Plane tree, and I eat part with him; and while I beheld him
eating greedily, I perceived that he waxed meigre and pale, and that
his lively colour faded away, insomuch that beeing in great fear, and
remembring those terrible furies of whom I lately dreamed, the first
morsell of bread that I put in my mouth (that was but very small) did
so stick in my jawes, that I could neither swallow it downe, nor yet
yeeld it up, and moreover the small time of our being together
increased my feare, and what is hee that seeing his companion die in
the high-way before his face, would not greatly lament and bee sorry?
But when that Socrates had eaten sufficiently hee waxed very thirsty,
for indeed he had well nigh devoured a whole Cheese: and behold evill
fortune! There was behind the Plane tree a pleasant running water as
cleere as Crystal, and I sayd unto him, Come hither Socrates to this
water and drinke thy fill. And then he rose and came to the River, and
kneeled downe on the side of the banke to drinke, but he had scarce
touched the water with lips, when as behold the wound in his throat
opened wide, and the Sponge suddenly fell out into the water, and after
issued out a little remnant of bloud, and his body being then without
life, had fallen into the river, had not I caught him by the leg and so
pulled him up. And after that I had lamented a good space the death of
my wretched companion, I buried him in the Sands there by the river.
Which done, in great feare I rode through many Outwayes and desart
places, and as culpable of the death of Socrates, I forsooke my
countrey, my wife, and my children, and came to Etolia where I married
another Wife.
This tale told Aristomenus, and his fellow which before obstinatly
would give no credit unto him, began to say, Verily there was never so
foolish a tale, nor a more absurd lie told than this. And then he spake
unto me saying, Ho sir, what you are I know not, but your habit and
countenance declareth that you should be some honest Gentleman,
(speaking to Apuleius) doe you beleeve this tale? Yea verily (quoth I),
why not? For whatsoever the fates have appointed to men, that I beleeve
shall happen. For may things chance unto me and unto you, and to divers
others, which beeing declared unto the ignorant be accounted as lies.
But verily I give credit unto his tale, and render entire thankes unto
him, in that by the pleasant relation thereof we have quickly passed
and shortned our journey, and I thinke that my horse was also delighted
with the same, and hath brought me to the gate of this city without any
paine at all. Thus ended both our talk and our journey, for they two
turned on the left hand to the next villages, and I rode into the city.
THE SIXTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius came unto a city named Hipate, and was lodged in one Milos
house, and brought him letters from one Demeas of Corinth.
After that those two Companions were departed I entred into the City:
where I espied an old woman, of whom I enquired whether that city was
called Hipata, or no: Who answered, Yes. Then I demaunded, Whether she
knew one Milo an Alderman of the city: Whereat she laughed and said:
Verily it is not without cause that Milo is called an Elderman, and
accounted as chiefe of those which dwel without the walls of the City.
To whom I sayd againe, I pray thee good mother do not mocke, but tell
me what manner of man he is, and where he dwelleth. Mary (quoth shee)
do you see these Bay windowes, which on one side abut to the gates of
the city, and on the other side to the next lane? There Milo dwelleth,
very rich both in mony and substance, but by reason of his great
avarice and insatiable covetousnes, he is evill spoken of, and he is a
man that liveth all by usurie, and lending his money upon pledges.
Moreover he dwelleth in a small house, and is ever counting his money,
and hath a wife that is a companion of his extreame misery, neither
keepeth he more in his house than onely one maid, who goeth apparelled
like unto a beggar. Which when I heard, I laughed in my self and
thought, In faith my friend Demeas hath served me well, which hath sent
me being a stranger, unto such a man, in whose house I shall not bee
afeared either of smoke or of the sent of meat; and therewithall I rode
to the doore, which was fast barred, and knocked aloud. Then there came
forth a maid which said, Ho sirrah that knocks so fast, in what kinde
of sort will you borrow money? Know you not that we use to take no
gage, unless it be either plate or Jewels? To whom I answered, I pray
you maid speak more gently, and tel me whether thy master be within or
no? Yes (quoth shee) that he is, why doe you aske? Mary (said I) I am
come from Corinth, and have brought him letters from Demeas his friend.
Then sayd the Maid, I pray you tarry here till I tell him so, and
therewithall she closed fast the doore, and went in, and after a while
she returned againe and sayd, My master desireth you to alight and come
in. And so I did, whereas I found him sitting upon a little bed, going
to supper, and his wife sate at his feet, but there was no meat upon
the table, and so by appointment of the maid I came to him and saluted
him, and delivered the letters which I had brought from Demeas. Which
when hee had read hee sayd, Verily, I thanke my friend Demeas much, in
that hee hath sent mee so worthy a guest as you are. And therewithall
hee commanded his wife to sit away and bid mee sit in her place; which
when I refused by reason of courtesie, hee pulled me by my garment and
willed me to sit downe; for wee have (quoth he) no other stool here,
nor no other great store of household stuffe, for fear of robbing. Then
I according to his commandement, sate down, and he fell in further
communication with me and sayd, Verily I doe conjecture by the comly
feature of your body, and by the maidenly shamefastnesse of your face
that you are a Gentleman borne, as my friend Demeas hath no lesse
declared the same in his letters. Wherfore I pray you take in good part
our poore lodging, and behold yonder chamber is at your commaundement,
use it as your owne, and if you be contented therewithall, you shall
resemble and follow the vertuous qualities of your good father Theseus,
who disdained not the slender and poore Cottage of Hecades.
And then he called his maid which was named Fotis, and said, Carry this
Gentlemans packet into the chamber, and lay it up safely, and bring
water quickly to wash him, and a towel to rub him, and other things
necessary, and then bring him to the next Baines, for I know that he is
very weary of travell.
These things when I heard, I partly perceived the manners of Milo, and
endeavouring to bring my selfe further into his favour, I sayd, Sir
there is no need of any of these things, for they have been everywhere
ministred unto mee by the way, howbeit I will go into the Baines, but
my chiefest care is that my horse be well looked to, for hee brought
mee hither roundly, and therefore I pray thee Fotis take this money and
buy some hay and oats for him.
THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius going to buy fish, met with his companion Pythias.
When this was done, and all my things brought into the Chamber, I
walked towards the Baines; but first I went to the market to buy some
victuals for my supper, whereas I saw great plenty of fish set out to
be sould: and so I cheapened part thereof, and that which they at first
held at an hundred pence, I bought at length for twenty. Which when I
had done, and was departing away, one of myne old acquaintance, and
fellow at Athens, named Pithias, fortuned to passe by, and viewing me
at a good space, in the end brought me to his remembrance, and gently
came and kissed mee, saying, O my deare friend Lucius, it is a great
while past since we two saw one another, and moreover, from the time
that wee departed from our Master Vestius, I never heard any newes from
you. I pray you Lucius tell me the cause of your peregrination hither.
Then I answered and sayd, I will make relation thereof unto you
tomorrow: but I pray you tell me, what meaneth these servitors that
follow you, and these rods or verges which they beare, and this habit
which you wear like unto a magistrate, verily I thinke you have
obtained your own desire, whereof I am right glad. Then answered
Pithias, I beare the office of the Clerke of the market, and therfore
if you will have any pittance for your supper speake and I will purvey
it for you. Then I thanked him heartily and sayd I had bought meat
sufficient already. But Pithias when hee espied my basket wherein my
fish was, tooke it and shaked it, and demanded of me what I had payd
for all my Sprots. In faith (quoth I), I could scarce inforce the
fishmonger to sell them for twenty pence. Which when I heard, he
brought me backe again into the market, and enquired of me of whom I
bought them. I shewed him the old man which sate in a corner, whome by
and by, by reason of his office, hee did greatly blame, and sayd, Is it
thus you serve and handle strangers, and specially our friends?
Wherefore sell you this fish so deare, which is not worth a halfepenny?
Now perceive I well, that you are an occasion to make this place, which
is the principall city of all Thessaly, to be forsaken of all men, and
to reduce it into an uninhabitable Desart, by reasone of your excessive
prices of victuals, but assure yourself that you shall not escape
without punishment, and you shall know what myne office is, and how I
ought to punish such as offend. Then he took my basket and cast the
fish on the ground, and commanded one of his Sergeants to tread them
under his feet. This done he perswaded me to depart, and sayd that
onely shame and reproach done unto the old Caitife did suffice him, So
I went away amazed and astonied, towards the Baines, considering with
myself and devising of the grace of my companion Pythias. Where when I
had well washed and refreshed my body, I returned againe to Milos
house, both without money and meat, and so got into my chamber. Then
came Fotis immediately unto mee, and said that her master desired me to
come to supper. But I not ignorant of Milos abstinence, prayed that I
might be pardoned since as I thought best to ease my wearied bones
rather with sleepe and quietnesse, than with meat. When Fotis had told
this to Milo, he came himselfe and tooke mee by the hand, and while I
did modestly excuse my selfe, I will not (quoth he) depart from this
place, until such time as you shall goe with me: and to confirm the
same, hee bound his words with an oath, whereby he enforced me to
follow him, and so he brought me into his chamber, where hee sate him
downe upon the bed, and demaunded of mee how his friend Demeas did, his
wife, his children, and all his family: and I made answer to him every
question, specially hee enquired the causes of my peregrination and
travell, which when I had declared, he yet busily demanded of the state
of my Countrey, and the chief magistrates there, and principally of our
Lievtenant and Viceroy; who when he perceived that I was not only
wearied by travell, but also with talke, and that I fell asleep in the
midst of my tale, and further that I spake nothing directly or
advisedly, he suffered me to depart to my chamber. So scaped I at
length from the prating and hungry supper of this rank old man, and
being compelled by sleepe and not by meat, and having supped only with
talke, I returned into my chamber, and there betooke me to my quiet and
long desired rest.
THE SECOND BOOKE
THE EIGHTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius fortuned to meet with his Cousin Byrrhena.
As soone as night was past, and the day began to spring, I fortuned to
awake, and rose out of my bed as halfe amazed, and very desirous to
know and see some marvellous and strange things, remembring with my
selfe that I was in the middle part of all Thessaly, whereas by the
common report of all the World, the Sorceries and Inchauntments are
most used, I oftentimes repeated with my self the tale of my companion
Aristomenus touching the manner of this City, and being mooved by great
desire, I viewed the whole scituation thereof, neither was there any
thing which I saw there, but that I did beleeve to be the same which it
was indeed, but every thing seemed unto me to be transformed and
altered into other shapes, by the wicked power of Sorcerie and
Inchantment, insomuch that I thought that the stones which I found were
indurate, and turned from men into that figure, and that the birds
which I heard chirping, and the trees without the walls of the city,
and the running waters, were changed from men into such kinde of
likenesses. And further I thought that the Statues, Images and Walls
could goe, and the Oxen and other brute beasts could speake and tell
strange newes, and that immediately I should see and heare some Oracles
from the heavens, and from the gleed of the Sun. Thus being astonied or
rather dismayed and vexed with desire, knowing no certaine place
whither I intended to go, I went from street to street, and at length
(as I curiously gazed on every thing) I fortuned unwares to come into
the market place, whereas I espied a certaine woman, accompanied with a
great many servants, towards whom I drew nigh, and viewed her garments
beset with gold and pretious stone, in such sort that she seemed to be
some noble matron. And there was an old man which followed her, who as
soon as he espied me, said to himself, Verily this is Lucius, and then
he came and embraced me, by and by he went unto his mistresse and
whispered in her eare, and came to mee againe saying, How is it Lucius
that you will not salute your deere Cousin and singular friend? To whom
I answered, Sir I dare not be so bold as to take acquaintance of an
unknown woman. Howbeit as halfe ashamed I drew towards her, and shee
turned her selfe and sayd, Behold how he resembleth the very same grace
as his mother Salvia doth, behold his countenance and stature, agreeing
thereto in each poynt, behold his comely state, his fine slendernesse,
his Vermilion colour, his haire yellow by nature, his gray and quicke
eye, like to the Eagle, and his trim and comely gate, which do
sufficiently prove him to be the naturall childe of Salvia. And
moreover she sayd, O Lucius, I have nourished thee with myne owne
proper hand: and why not? For I am not onely of kindred to thy mother
by blood, but also by nourice, for wee both descended of the line of
Plutarch, lay in one belly, sucked the same paps, and were brought up
together in one house. And further there is no other difference
betweene us two, but that she is married more honourably than I: I am
the same Byrrhena whom you have often heard named among your friends at
home: wherfore I pray you to take so much pains as to come with me to
my house, and use it as your owne. At whose words I was partly abashed
and sayd, God forbid Cosin that I should forsake myne Host Milo without
any reasonable cause; but verily I will, as often as I have occasion to
passe by thy house, come and see how you doe. And while we were talking
thus together, little by little wee came to her house, and behold the
gates of the same were very beautifully set with pillars quadrangle
wise, on the top wherof were placed carved statues and images, but
principally the Goddesse of Victory was so lively and with such
excellencie portrayed and set forth, that you would have verily have
thought that she had flyed, and hovered with her wings hither and
thither. On the contrary part, the image of the Goddesse Diana was
wrought in white marble, which was a marvellous sight to see, for shee
seemed as though the winde did blow up her garments, and that she did
encounter with them that came into the house. On each side of her were
Dogs made of stone, that seemed to menace with their fiery eyes, their
pricked eares, their bended nosethrils, their grinning teeth in such
sort that you would have thought they had bayed and barked. An moreover
(which was a greater marvel to behold) the excellent carver and deviser
of this worke had fashioned the dogs to stand up fiercely with their
former feet, and their hinder feet on the ground ready to fight.
Behinde the back of the goddesse was carved a stone in manner of a
Caverne, environed with mosse, herbes, leaves, sprigs, green branches
and bowes, growing in and about the same, insomuch that within the
stone it glistered and shone marvellously, under the brim of the stone
hanged apples and grapes carved finely, wherein Art envying Nature,
shewed her great cunning. For they were so lively set out, that you
would have thought if Summer had been come, they might have bin pulled
and eaten; and while I beheld the running water, which seemed to spring
and leap under the feet of the goddesse, I marked the grapes which
hanged in the water, which were like in every point to the grapes of
the vine, and seemed to move and stir by the violence of the streame.
Moreover, amongst the branches of the stone appeared the image of
Acteon: and how that Diana (which was carved within the same stone,
standing in the water) because he did see her naked, did turne him into
an hart, and so he was torne and slaine of his owne hounds. And while I
was greatly delighted with the view of these things, Byrrhena spake to
me and sayd, Cousin all things here be at your commandement. And
therewithall shee willed secretly the residue to depart: who being gone
she sayd, My most deare Cousin Lucius, I do sweare by the goddesse
Diana, that I doe greatly tender your safety, and am as carefull for
you as if you were myne owne naturall childe, beware I say, beware of
the evil arts and wicked allurements of that Pamphiles who is the wife
of Milo, whom you call your Host, for she is accounted the most chief
and principall Magitian and Enchantresse living, who by breathing out
certain words and charmes over bowes, stones and other frivolous
things, can throw down all the powers of the heavens into the deep
bottome of hell, and reduce all the whole world againe to the old
Chaos. For as soone as she espieth any comely yong man, shee is
forthwith stricken with his love, and presently setteth her whole minde
and affection on him. She soweth her seed of flattery, she invades his
spirit and intangleth him with continuall snares of unmeasurable love.
And then if any accord not to her filthy desire, or if they seeme
loathsome in her eye, by and by in the moment of an houre she turneth
them into stones, sheep or some other beast, as her selfe pleaseth, and
some she presently slayeth and murthereth, of whom I would you should
earnestly beware. For she burneth continually, and you by reason of
your tender age and comely beauty are capable of her fire and love.
Thus with great care Byrrhena gave me in charge, but I (that always
coveted and desired, after that I had heard talk of such Sorceries and
Witchcrafts, to be experienced in the same) little esteemed to beware
of Pamphiles, but willingly determined to bestow my money in learning
of that art, and now wholly to become a Witch. And so I waxed joyful,
and wringing my selfe out of her company, as out of linkes or chaines,
I bade her farewell, and departed toward the house of myne host Milo,
by the way reasoning thus with my selfe: O Lucius now take heed, be
vigilant, have a good care, for now thou hast time and place to
satisfie thy desire, now shake off thy childishnesse and shew thy selfe
a man, but especially temper thy selfe from the love of thyne hostesse,
and abstain from violation of the bed of Milo, but hardly attempt to
winne the maiden Fotis, for she is beautifull, wanton and pleasant in
talke. And soone when thou goest to sleepe, and when shee bringeth you
gently into thy chamber, and tenderly layeth thee downe in thy bed, and
lovingly covereth thee, and kisseth thee sweetly, and departeth
unwillingly, and casteth her eyes oftentimes backe, and stands still,
then hast thou a good occasion ministred to thee to prove and try the
mind of Fotis. Thus while I reasoned to myselfe I came to Milos doore,
persevering still in my purpose, but I found neither Milo nor his wife
at home.
THE NINTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius fell in love with Fotis.
When I was within the house I found my deare and sweet love Fotis
mincing of meat and making pottage for her master and mistresse, the
Cupboord was all set with wines, and I thought I smelled the savor of
some dainty meats: she had about her middle a white and clean apron,
and shee was girded about her body under the paps with a swathell of
red silke, and she stirred the pot and turned the meat with her fair
and white hands, in such sort that with stirring and turning the same,
her loynes and hips did likewise move and shake, which was in my mind a
comely sight to see.
These things when I saw I was halfe amazed, and stood musing with my
selfe, and my courage came then upon mee, which before was scant. And I
spake unto Fotis merrily and sayd, O Fotis how trimmely you can stirre
the pot, and how finely, with shaking your buttockes, you can make
pottage. O happy and twice happy is hee to whom you give leave and
licence but to touch you there. Then shee beeing likewise merrily
disposed, made answer, Depart I say, Miser from me, depart from my
fire, for if the flame thereof doe never so little blaze forth, it will
burne thee extreamely and none can extinguish the heat thereof but I
alone, who in stirring the pot and making the bed can so finely shake
my selfe. When she had sayd these words shee cast her eyes upon me and
laughed, but I did not depart from thence until such time as I had
viewed her in every point. But what should I speak of others, when as I
doe accustome abroad to marke the face and haire of every dame, and
afterwards delight my selfe therewith privately at home, and thereby
judge the residue of their shape, because the face is the principall
part of all the body, and is first open to our eyes. And whatsoever
flourishing and gorgeous apparell doth work and set forth in the
corporal parts of a woman, the same doth the naturall and comely beauty
set out in the face. Moreover there be divers, that to the intent to
shew their grace and feature, wil cast off their partlets, collars,
habiliments, fronts, cornets and krippins, and doe more delight to shew
the fairnesse of their skinne, than to deck themselves up in gold and
pretious stones. But because it is a crime unto me to say so, and to
give no example thereof, know ye, that if you spoyle and cut the haire
of any woman or deprive her of the colour of her face, though shee were
never so excellent in beauty, though shee were throwne downe from
heaven, sprung of the Seas, nourished of the flouds, though shee were
Venus her selfe, though shee were waited upon by all the Court of
Cupid, though were girded with her beautifull skarfe of Love, and
though shee smelled of perfumes and musks, yet if shee appeared bald,
shee could in no wise please, no not her owne Vulcanus.
O how well doth a faire colour and a shining face agree with glittering
hair! Behold, it encountreth with the beams of the Sunne, and pleaseth
the eye marvellously. Sometimes the beauty of the haire resembleth the
colour of gold and honey, sometimes the blew plumes and azured feathers
about the neckes of Doves, especially when it is either anointed with
the gumme of Arabia, or trimmely tuft out with the teeth of a fine
combe, which if it be tyed up in the pole of the necke, it seemeth to
the lover that beholdeth the same, as a glasse that yeeldeth forth a
more pleasant and gracious comelinesse than if it should be sparsed
abroad on the shoulders of the woman, or hang down scattering behind.
Finally there is such a dignity in the haire, that whatsoever shee be,
though she be never to bravely attyred with gold, silks, pretious
stones, and other rich and gorgeous ornaments, yet if her hair be not
curiously set forth shee cannot seeme faire. But in my Fotis, her
garments unbrast and unlaste increased her beauty, her haire hanged
about her shoulders, and was dispersed abroad upon her partlet, and in
every part of her necke, howbeit the greater part was trussed upon her
pole with a lace. Then I unable to sustain the broiling heat that I was
in, ran upon her and kissed the place where she had thus laid her
haire. Whereat she turned her face, and cast her rolling eyes upon me,
saying, O Scholler, thou hast tasted now both hony and gall, take heed
that thy pleasure do not turn unto repentance. Tush (quoth I) my sweet
heart, I am contented for such another kiss to be broiled here upon
this fire, wherwithall I embraced and kissed her more often, and shee
embraced and kissed me likewise, and moreover her breath smelled like
Cinnamon, and the liquor of her tongue was like unto sweet Nectar,
wherewith when my mind was greatly delighted I sayd, Behold Fotis I am
yours, and shall presently dye unlesse you take pitty upon me. Which
when I had said she eftsoone kissed me, and bid me be of good courage,
and I will (quoth shee) satisfie your whole desire, and it shall be no
longer delayed than until night, when as assure your selfe I will come
and lie with you; wherfore go your wayes and prepare your selfe, for I
intend valiantly and couragiously to encounter with you this night.
Thus when we had lovingly talked and reasoned together, we departed for
that time.
THE TENTH CHAPTER
How Byrrhena sent victuals unto Apuleius, and how hee talked with Milo
of Diophanes, and how he lay with Fotis.
When noone was come, Byrrhena sent to me a fat Pigge, five hennes, and
a flagon of old wine. Then I called Fotis and sayd, Behold how Bacchus
the egger and stirrer of Venery, doth offer him self of his owne
accord, let us therefore drink up this wine, that we may prepare our
selves and get us courage against soone, for Venus wanteth no other
provision than this, that the Lamp may be all the night replenished
with oyle, and the cups with wine. The residue of the day I passed away
at the Bains and in banquetting, and towards evening I went to supper,
for I was bid by Milo, and so I sate downe at the table, out of
Pamphiles sight as much as I could, being mindfull of the commandement
of Byrrhena, and sometimes I would cast myne eyes upon her as upon the
furies of hell, but I eftsoones turning my face behinde me, and
beholding my Fotis ministring at the table, was again refreshed and
made merry. And behold when Pamphiles did see the candle standing on
the table, she said, Verily wee shall have much raine to morrow. Which
when her husband did heare, he demanded of her by what reason she knew
it? Mary (quoth shee) the light on the table sheweth the same. Then
Milo laughed and said, Verily we nourish a Sybel prophesier, which by
the view of a candle doth divine of Celestiall things, and of the Sunne
it selfe. Then I mused in my minde and said unto Milo, Of truth it is a
good experience and proof of divination. Neither is it any marvell, for
although this light is but a small light, and made by the hands of men,
yet hath it a remembrance of that great and heavenly light, as of his
parent, and doth shew unto us what will happen in the Skies above. For
I knew at Corinth a certain man of Assyria, who would give answers in
every part of the City, and for the gaine of money would tell every man
his fortune, to some he would tel the dayes of their marriages, to
others he would tell when they should build, that their edifices should
continue. To others, when they should best goe about their affaires. To
others, when they should goe by sea or land: to me, purposing to take
my journey hither, he declared many things strange and variable. For
sometimes hee sayd that I should win glory enough: sometimes he sayd I
should write a great Historie: sometimes againe hee sayd that I should
devise an incredible tale: and sometimes that I should make Bookes.
Whereat Milo laughed againe, and enquired of me, of what stature this
man of Assyria was, and what he was named. In faith (quoth I) he is a
tall man and somewhat blacke, and hee is called Diophanes. Then sayd
Milo, the same is he and no other, who semblably hath declared many
things here unto us, whereby hee got and obtained great substance and
Treasure.
But the poore miser fell at length into the hands of unpittifull and
cruell fortune: For beeing on a day amongst a great assembly of people,
to tell the simple sort their fortune, a certaine Cobler came unto him,
and desired him to tel when it should be best for him to take his
voyage, the which hee promised to do: the Cobler opened his purse and
told a hundred pence to him for his paines. Whereupon came a certaine
young gentleman and took Diophanes by the Garment. Then he turning
himselfe, embraced and kissed him, and desired the Gentleman, who was
one of his acquaintance, to sit downe by him: and Diophanes being
astonied with this sudden change, forgot what he was doing, and sayd, O
deare friend you are heartily welcome, I pray you when arrived you into
these parts? Then answered he, I will tell you soone, but brother I
pray you tell mee of your comming from the isle of Euboea, and how you
sped by the way? Whereunto Diophanes this notable Assyrian (not yet
come unto his minde, but halfe amased) soone answered and sayd, I would
to god that all our enemies and evil willers might fall into the like
dangerous peregrination and trouble. For the ship where we were in,
after it was by the waves of the seas and by the great tempests tossed
hither and thither, in great peril, and after that the mast and stern
brake likewise in pieces, could in no wise be brought to shore, but
sunk into the water, and so we did swim, and hardly escaped to land.
And after that, whatsoever was given unto us in recompense of our
losses, either by the pitty of strangers, or by the benevolence of our
friends, was taken away from us by theeves, whose violence when my
brother Arisuatus did assay to resist, hee was cruelly murthered by
them before my face. These things when he had sadly declared, the
Cobler tooke up his money againe which he had told out to pay for the
telling of his fortune, and ran away. The Diophanes comming to himselfe
perceived what he had done, and we all that stood by laughed greatly.
But that (quoth Milo) which Diophanes did tell unto you Lucius, that
you should be happy and have a prosperous journey, was only true. Thus
Milo reasoned with me. But I was not a little sorry that I had traind
him into such a vaine of talke, that I lost a good part of the night,
and the sweete pleasure thereof: but at length I boldly said to Milo,
Let Diophanes fare well with his evil fortune, and get againe that
which he lost by sea and land, for I verily do yet feel the wearinesse
of my travell, whereof I pray you pardon mee, and give me licence to
depart to bed: wherewithall I rose up and went unto my chamber, where I
found all things finely prepared and the childrens bed (because they
should not heare what we did in the night) was removed far off without
the chamber doore. The table was all covered with those meats that were
left at supper, the cups were filled halfe full with water, to temper
and delay the wines, the flagon stood ready prepared, and there lacked
nothing that was necessary for the preparation of Venus. And when I was
entring into the bed, behold my Fotis (who had brought her mistresse to
bed) came in and gave me roses and floures which she had in her apron,
and some she threw about the bed, and kissed mee sweetly, and tied a
garland about my head, and bespred the chamber with the residue. Which
when shee had done, shee tooke a cup of wine and delaied it with hot
water, and profered it me to drinke; and before I had drunk it all off
she pulled it from my mouth, and then gave it me againe, and in this
manner we emptied the pot twice or thrice together. Thus when I had
well replenished my self with wine, and was now ready unto Venery not
onely in minde but also in body, I removed my cloathes, and shewing to
Fotis my great impatiencie I sayd, O my sweet heart take pitty upon me
and helpe me, for as you see I am now prepared unto the battell, which
you your selfe did appoint: for after that I felt the first Arrow of
cruell Cupid within my breast, I bent my bow very strong, and now
feare, (because it is bended so hard) lest my string should breake: but
that thou mayst the better please me, undresse thy haire and come and
embrace me lovingly: whereupon shee made no long delay, but set aside
all the meat and wine, and then she unapparelled her selfe, and
unattyred her haire, presenting her amiable body unto me in manner of
faire Venus, when shee goeth under the waves of the sea. Now (quoth
shee) is come the houre of justing, now is come the time of warre,
wherefore shew thy selfe like unto a man, for I will not retyre, I will
not fly the field, see then thou bee valiant, see thou be couragious,
since there is no time appointed when our skirmish shall cease. In
saying these words shee came to me to bed, and embraced me sweetly, and
so wee passed all the night in pastime and pleasure, and never slept
until it was day: but we would eftsoones refresh our wearinesse, and
provoke our pleasure, and renew our venery by drinking of wine. In
which sort we pleasantly passed away many other nights following.
THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius supped with Byrrhena, and what a strange tale Bellephoron
told at the table.
It fortuned on a day, that Byrrhena desired me earnestly to suppe with
her; and shee would in no wise take any excusation. Whereupon I went to
Fotis, to aske counsell of her as of some Divine, who although she was
unwilling that I should depart one foot from her company, yet at length
shee gave me license to bee absent for a while, saying, Beware that you
tarry not long at supper there, for there is a rabblement of common
Barrettors and disturbers of the publique peace, that rove about in the
streets and murther all such as they may take, neither can law nor
justice redress them in any case. And they will the sooner set upon
you, by reason of your comelinesse and audacity, in that you are not
afeared at any time to walke in the streets.
Then I answered and sayd, Have no care of me Fotis, for I esteeme the
pleasure which I have with thee, above the dainty meats that I eat
abroad, and therefore I will returne againe quickly. Neverthelesse I
minde not to come without company, for I have here my sword, wherby I
hope to defend my selfe.
And so in this sort I went to supper, and behold I found in Byrrhena’s
house a great company of strangers, and the chiefe and principall of
the city: the beds made of Citron and Ivory, were richly adorned and
spread with cloath of gold, the Cups were garnished pretiously, and
there were divers other things of sundry fashion, but of like
estimation and price: here stood a glasse gorgeously wrought, there
stood another of Christall finely painted. There stood a cup of
glittering silver, and there stood another of shining gold, and here
was another of amber artificially carved and made with pretious stones.
Finally, there was all things that might be desired: the Servitors
waited orderly at the table in rich apparell, the pages arrayed in
silke robes, did fill great gemmes and pearles made in the forme of
cups, with excellent wine. Then one brought in Candles and Torches, and
when we were set down and placed in order, we began to talke, to laugh,
and to be merry. And Byrrhena spake unto mee and sayd, I pray you
Cousine how like you our countrey? Verily I think there is no other
City which hath the like Temples, Baynes, and other commodities which
we have here. Further we have abundance of household stuffe, we have
pleasure, we have ease, and when the Roman merchants arrive in this
City they are gently and quietly entertained, and all that dwell within
this province (when they purpose to solace and repose themselves) do
come to this city. Whereunto I answered, Verily (quoth I) you tell
truth, for I can finde no place in all the world which I like better
than this, but I greatly feare the blind inevitable trenches of
witches, for they say that the dead bodies are digged out of their
graves, and the bones of them that are burnt be stollen away, and the
toes and fingers of such as are slaine are cut off, and afflict and
torment such as live. And the old Witches as soone as they heare of the
death of any person, do forthwith goe and uncover the hearse and spoyle
the corpse, to work their inchantments. Then another sitting at the
table spake and sayd, In faith you say true, neither yet do they spare
or favor the living. For I know one not farre hence that was cruelly
handled by them, who being not contented with cutting off his nose, did
likewise cut off his eares, whereat all the people laughed heartily,
and looked at one that sate at the boords end, who being amased at
their gazing, and somewhat angry withall, would have risen from the
table, had not Byrrhena spake unto him and sayd, I pray thee friend
Bellerophon sit still and according to thy accustomed curtesie declare
unto us the losse of thy nose and eares, to the end that my cousin
Lucius may be delighted with the pleasantnes of the tale. To whom he
answered, Madam in the office of your bounty shall prevaile herein, but
the insolencie of some is not to be supported. This hee spake very
angerly: But Byrrhena was earnest upon him, and assured him hee should
have no wrong at any mans hand. Whereby he was inforced to declare the
same, and so lapping up the end of the Table cloath and carpet
together, hee leaned with his elbow thereon, and held out three
forefingers of his right hand in manner of an orator, and sayd, When I
was a young man I went unto a certaine city called Milet, to see the
games and triumphs there named Olympia, and being desirous to come into
this famous province, after that I had travelled over all Thessaly, I
fortuned in an evil hour to come to the City Larissa, where while I
went up and down to view the streets to seeke some reliefe for my poore
estate (for I had spent all my money) I espied an old man standing on a
stone in the middest of the market place, crying with a loud voice and
saying, that if any man would watch a dead corps that night hee should
be reasonably rewarded for this paines. Which when I heard, I sayd to
one who passed by, What is here to doe? Do dead men use to run away in
this Countrey? Then answered he, Hold your peace, for you are but a
Babe and a stranger here, and not without cause you are ignorant how
you are in Thessaly, where the women Witches bite off by morsels the
flesh and faces of dead men, and thereby work their sorceries and
inchantments. Then quoth I, In good fellowship tell me the order of
this custody and how it is. Marry (quoth he) first you must watch all
the night, with your eyes bent continually upon the Corps, never
looking off, nor moving aside. For these Witches do turn themselves
into sundry kindes of beasts, whereby they deceive the eyes of all men,
sometimes they are transformed into birds, sometimes into Dogs and
Mice, and sometimes into flies. Moreover they will charme the keepers
of the corps asleepe, neither can it be declared what meanes and shifts
these wicked women do use, to bring their purpose to passe: and the
reward for such dangerous watching is no more than foure or sixe
shillings. But hearken further (for I had well nigh forgotten) if the
keeper of the dead body doe not render on the morning following, the
corps whole and sound as he received the same, he shall be punished in
this sort: That is, if the corps be diminished or spoyled in any part
of his face, hands or toes, the same shall be diminished and spoyled in
the keeper. Which when I heard him I tooke a good heart, and went unto
the Crier and bid him cease, for I would take the matter in hand, and
so I demanded what I should have. Marry (quoth he) a thousand pence,
but beware I say you young man, that you do wel defend the dead corps
from the wicked witches, for hee was the son of one of the chiefest of
the city. Tush (sayd I) you speak you cannot tell what, behold I am a
man made all of iron, and have never desire to sleepe, and am more
quicke of sight than Lynx or Argus. I had scarse spoken these words,
when he tooke me by the hand and brought mee to a certaine house, the
gate whereof was closed fast, so that I went through the wicket, then
he brought me into a chamber somewhat darke, and shewed me a Matron
cloathed in mourning vesture, and weeping in lamentable wise. And he
spake unto her and said, Behold here is one that will enterprise to
watch the corpes of your husband this night. Which when she heard she
turned her blubbered face covered with haire unto me saying, I pray you
good man take good heed, and see well to your office. Have no care
(quoth I) so you will give mee any thing above that which is due to be
given. Wherewith shee was contented, and then she arose and brought me
into a chamber whereas the corps lay covered with white sheets, and
shee called seven witnesses, before whom she shewed the dead body, and
every part and parcell thereof, and with weeping eyes desired them all
to testifie the matter. Which done, she sayd these words of course as
follow: Behold, his nose is whole, his eyes safe, his eares without
scarre, his lips untouched, and his chin sound: all which was written
and noted in tables, and subscribed with the hands of witnesses to
confirme the same. Which done I sayd unto the matron, Madam I pray you
that I may have all things here necessary. What is that? (quoth she).
Marry (quoth I) a great lampe with oyle, pots of wine, and water to
delay the same, and some other drinke and dainty dish that was left at
supper. Then she shaked her head and sayd, Away fool as thou art,
thinkest thou to play the glutton here and to looke for dainty meats
where so long time hath not been seene any smoke at all? Commest thou
hither to eat, where we should weepe and lament? And therewithall she
turned backe, and commanded her maiden Myrrhena to deliver me a lampe
with oyle, which when shee had done they closed the chamber doore and
departed. Now when I was alone, I rubbed myne eyes, and armed my selfe
to keep the corpes, and to the intent I would not sleepe, I began to
sing, and so I passed the time until it was midnight, when as behold
there crept in a Wesel into the chamber, and she came against me and
put me in very great feare, insomuch that I marvelled greatly at the
audacity of so little a beast. To whom I said, get thou hence thou
whore and hie thee to thy fellowes, lest thou feele my fingers. Why
wilt thou not goe? Then incontinently she ranne away, and when she was
gon, I fell on the ground so fast asleepe, that Apollo himself could
not discern which of us two was the dead corps, for I lay prostrat as
one without life, and needed a keeper likewise. At length the cockes
began to crow, declaring that it was day: wherewithall I awaked, and
being greatly afeard ran to the dead body with the lamp in my hand, and
I viewed him round about: and immediately came in the matron weeping
with her Witnesses, and ran to the corps, and eftsoons kissing him, she
turned his body and found no part diminished. Then she willed
Philodespotus her steward to pay me my wages forthwith. Which when he
had done he sayd, We thanke you gentle young man for your paines and
verily for your diligence herein we will account you as one of the
family. Whereunto I (being joyous of by unhoped gaine, and ratling my
money in my hand) did answer, I pray you madam esteeme me as one of
your servants, and if you want my service at any time, I am at your
commandement. I had not fully declared these words, when as behold all
the servants of the house were assembled with weapons to drive me away,
one buffeted me about the face, another about the shoulders, some
strook me in the sides, some kicked me, and some tare my garments, and
so I was handled amongst them and driven from the house, as the proud
young man Adonis who was torn by a Bore. And when I was come into the
next street, I mused with my selfe, and remembred myne unwise and
unadvised words which I had spoken, whereby I considered that I had
deserved much more punishment, and that I was worthily beaten for my
folly. And by and by the corps came forth, which because it was the
body of one of the chiefe of the city, was carried in funeral pompe
round about the market place, according to the right of the countrey
there. And forthwith stepped out an old man weeping and lamenting, and
ranne unto the Biere and embraced it, and with deepe sighes and sobs
cried out in this sort, O masters, I pray you by the faith which you
professe, and by the duty which you owe unto the weale publique, take
pitty and mercy upon this dead corps, who is miserably murdered, and
doe vengeance on this wicked and cursed woman his wife which hath
committed this fact: for it is shee and no other which hath poysoned
her husband my sisters sonne, to the intent to maintaine her whoredome,
and to get his heritage. In this sort the old man complained before the
face of all people. Then they (astonied at these sayings, and because
the thing seemed to be true) cried out, Burne her, burne her, and they
sought for stones to throw at her, and willed the boys in the street to
doe the same. But shee weeping in lamentable wise, did swear by all the
gods, that shee was not culpable of this crime. No quoth the old man,
here is one sent by the providence of God to try out the matter, even
Zachlas an Egypptian, who is the most principall Prophecier in all this
countrey, and who was hired of me for money to reduce the soule of this
man from hell, and to revive his body for the triall hereof. And
therewithall he brought forth a certaine young man cloathed in linnen
rayment, having on his feet a paire of pantofiles, and his crowne
shaven, who kissed his hands and knees, saying, O priest have mercy,
have mercy I pray thee by the Celestiall Planets, by the Powers
infernall, by the vertue of the naturall elements, by the silences of
the night, by the building of Swallows nigh unto the towne Copton, by
the increase of the floud Nilus, by the secret mysteries of Memphis,
and by the instruments and trumpets of the Isle Pharos, have mercy I
say, and call to life this dead body, and make that his eyes which he
closed and shut, may be open and see. Howbeit we meane not to strive
against the law of death, neither intend we to deprive the earth of his
right, but to the end this fact may be knowne, we crave but a small
time and space of life. Whereat this Prophet was mooved, and took a
certaine herb and layd it three times against the mouth of the dead,
and he took another and laid upon his breast in like sort. Thus when
hee had done hee turned himself into the East, and made certaine
orisons unto the Sunne, which caused all the people to marvell greatly,
and to looke for this strange miracle that should happen. Then I
pressed in amongst them nigh unto the biere, and got upon a stone to
see this mysterie, and behold incontinently the dead body began to
receive spirit, his principall veines did moove, his life came again
and he held up his head and spake in this sort: Why doe you call mee
backe againe to this transitorie life, that have already tasted of the
water of Lethe, and likewise been in the deadly den of Styx? Leave off,
I pray, leave off, and let me lie in quiet rest. When these words were
uttered by the dead corps, the Prophet drew nigh unto the Biere and
sayd, I charge thee to tell before the face of all the people here the
occasion of thy death: What, dost thou thinke that I cannot by my
conjurations call up the dead, and by my puissance torment thy body?
Then the corps moved his head again, and made reverence to the people
and sayd, Verily I was poisoned by the meanes of my wicked wife, and so
thereby yeelded my bed unto an adulterer. Whereat his wife taking
present audacity, and reproving his sayings, with a cursed minde did
deny it. The people were bent against her sundry wayes, some thought
best that shee should be buried alive with her husband: but some said
that there ought no credit to be given to the dead body. Which opinion
was cleane taken away, by the words which the corps spoke againe and
sayd, Behold I will give you some evident token, which never yet any
other man knew, whereby you shall perceive that I declare the truth:
and by and by he pointed towards me that stood on the stone, and sayd,
When this the good Gard of my body watched me diligently in the night,
and that the wicked Witches and enchantresses came into the chamber to
spoyle mee of my limbes, and to bring such their purpose did transforme
themselves into the shape of beasts: and when as they could in no wise
deceive or beguile his vigilant eyes, they cast him into so dead and
sound a sleepe, that by their witchcraft he seemed without spirit or
life. After this they did call me by my name, and never did cease til
as the cold members of my body began by little and little and little to
revive. Then he being of more lively soule, howbeit buried in sleep, in
that he and I were named by one name, and because he knew not that they
called me, rose up first, and as one without sence or perseverance
passed by the dore fast closed, unto a certain hole, whereas the
Witches cut off first his nose, and then his ears, and so that was done
to him which was appointed to be done to me. And that such their
subtility might not be perceived, they made him a like paire of eares
and nose of wax: wherfore you may see that the poore miser for lucre of
a little mony sustained losse of his members. Which when he had said I
was greatly astonied, and minding to prove whether his words were true
or no, put my hand to my nose, and my nose fell off, and put my hand to
my ears and my ears fell off. Wherat all the people wondred greatly,
and laughed me to scorne: but I beeing strucken in a cold sweat, crept
between their legs for shame and escaped away. So I disfigured returned
home againe, and covered the losse of myne ears with my long hair, and
glewed this clout to my face to hide my shame. As soon as Bellephoron
had told his tale, they which sate at the table replenished with wine,
laughed heartily. And while they drank one to another, Byrrhena spake
to me and said, from the first foundation of this city we have a
custome to celebrate the festivall day of the god Risus, and to-morrow
is the feast when as I pray you to bee present, to set out the same
more honourably, and I would with all my heart that you could find or
devise somewhat of your selfe, that might be in honour of so great a
god. To whom I answered, verily cousin I will do as you command me, and
right glad would I be, if I might invent any laughing or merry matter
to please or satisfy Risus withall. Then I rose from the table and took
leave of Byrrhena and departed. And when I came into the first street
my torch went out, that with great pain I could scarce get home, by
reason it was so dark, for fear of stumbling: and when I was well nigh
come unto the dore, behold I saw three men of great stature, heaving
and lifting at Milos gates to get in: and when they saw me they were
nothing afeard, but assaied with more force to break down the dores
whereby they gave mee occasion, and not without cause, to thinke that
they were strong theeves. Whereupon I by and by drew out my sword which
I carried for that purpose under my cloak, and ran in amongst them, and
wounded them in such sort that they fell downe dead before my face.
Thus when I had slaine them all, I knocked sweating and breathing at
the doore til Fotis let me in. And then full weary with the slaughter
of those Theeves, like Hercules when he fought against the king Gerion,
I went to my chamber and layd me down to sleep.
THE THIRD BOOKE
THE TWELFTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was taken and put in prison for murther.
When morning was come, and that I was awaked from sleep, my heart
burned sore with remembrance of the murther I had committed the night
before: and I rose and sate downe on the side of the bed with my legges
acrosse, and wringing my hands, I weeped in most miserable sort. For I
imagined with my selfe, that I was brought before the Judge in the
Judgement place, and that he awarded sentence against me, and that the
hangman was ready to lead me to the gallows. And further I imagined and
sayd, Alasse what Judge is he that is so gentle or benigne, that will
thinke that I am unguilty of the slaughter and murther of these three
men. Howbeit the Assyrian Diophanes did firmely assure unto me, that my
peregrination and voyage hither should be prosperous. But while I did
thus unfold my sorrowes, and greatly bewail my fortune, behold I heard
a great noyse and cry at the dore, and in came the Magistrates and
officers, who commanded two sergeants to binde and leade me to prison,
whereunto I was willingly obedient, and as they led me through the
street, all the City gathered together and followed me, and although I
looked always on the ground for very shame, yet sometimes I cast my
head aside and marvelled greatly that among so many thousand people
there was not one but laughed exceedingly. Finally, when they had
brought me through all the streets of the city, in manner of those that
go in procession, and do sacrifice to mitigate the ire of the gods,
they placed mee in the Judgement hall, before the seat of the Judges:
and after that the Crier had commanded all men to keep silence, and
people desired the Judges to give sentence in the great Theatre, by
reason of the great multitude that was there, whereby they were in
danger of stifling. And behold the prease of people increased stil,
some climed to the top of the house, some got upon the beames, some
upon the Images, and some thrust their heads through the windowes,
little regarding the dangers they were in, so they might see me.
Then the officers brought mee forth openly into the middle of the hall,
that every man might behold me. And after that the Cryer had made a
noise, and willed all such that would bring any evidence against me,
should come forth, there stept out an old man with a glasse of water in
his hand, dropping out softly, who desired that hee might have liberty
to speake during the time of the continuance of the water. Which when
it was granted, he began his oration in this sort.
THE THIRTEENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was accused by an old man, and how he answered for
himselfe.
O most reverend and just Judges, the thing which I propose to declare
to you is no small matter, but toucheth the estate and tranquillity of
this whole City, and the punishment thereof may be a right good example
to others. Wherefore I pray you most venerable Fathers, to whom and
every one of whom it doth appertain, to provide for the dignity and
safety of the Commonweale, that you would in no wise suffer this wicked
Homicide, embrued with the bloud of so many murthered citisens, to
escape unpunished. And thinke you not that I am moved thereunto by envy
or hatred, but by reason of my office, in that I am captain of the
night Watch, and because no man alive should accuse mee to bee remisse
in the same I wil declare all the whole matter, orderly as it was done
last night.
This night past, when as at our accustomed houre I diligently searched
every part of the City, behold I fortuned to espy this cruell young man
drawing out his sword against three Citisens, and after a long combat
foughten between them, he murthered one after another miserably: which
when hee had done, moved in his conscience at so great a crime hee ran
away, and aided by the reason of darknes, slipt into a house, and there
lay hidden all night, but by the providence of the Gods, which
suffereth no heynous offence to pass unpunished, hee was taken by us
this morning before he escaped any further, and so brought hither to
your honourable presence to receive his desert accordingly.
So have you here a guilty person, a culpable homicide, and an accused
stranger, wherefore pronounce you judgement against this man beeing an
alien, when as you would most severely and sharply revenge such an
offence found in a known Citisen. In this sort the cruell accuser
finished and ended his terrible tale. Then the Crier commanded me to
speake, if I had any thing to say for my selfe, but I could in no wise
utter any word at all for weeping. And on the other side I esteemed not
so much his rigorous accusation, as I did consider myne owne miserable
conscience. Howbeit, beeing inspired by divine Audacity, at length I
gan say, Verily I know that it is an hard thing for him that is accused
to have slaine three persons, to perswade you that he is innocent,
although he should declare the whole truth, and confesse the matter how
it was indeed, but if your honours will vouchsafe to give me audience,
I will shew you, that if I am condemned to die, I have not deserved it
as myne owne desert, but that I was mooved by fortune and reasonable
cause to doe that fact. For returning somewhat late from supper yester
night (beeing well tippled with wine, which I will not deny) and
approaching nigh to my common lodging, which was in the house of one
Milo a Citisen of this city, I fortuned to espy three great theeves
attempting to break down his walls and gates, and to open the locks to
enter in. And when they had removed the dores out of the hookes, they
consulted amongst themselves, how they would handle such as they found
in the house. And one of them being of more courage, and of greater
stature than the rest, spake unto his fellows and sayd, Tush you are
but boyes, take mens hearts unto you, and let us enter into every part
of the house, and such as we find asleep let us kill, and so by that
meanes we shall escape without danger. Verily ye three Judges, I
confess that I drew out my sword against those three Citizens, but I
thought it was the office and duty of one that beareth good will to
this weale publique, so to doe, especially since they put me in great
fear, and assayed to rob and spoyl my friend Milo. But when those
cruell and terrible men would in no case run away, nor feare my naked
sword, but boldly resist against me, I ran upon them and fought
valiantly. One of them which was the captain invaded me strongly, and
drew me by the haire with both his hands, and began to beat me with a
great stone: but in the end I proved the hardier man, and threw him
downe at my feet and killed him. I tooke likewise the second that
clasped me about the legs and bit me, and slew him also. And the third
that came running violently against me, after that I had strucken him
under the stomacke fell downe dead. Thus when I had delivered my selfe,
the house, Myne host, and all his family from this present danger, I
thought that I should not onely escape unpunished, but also have some
great reward of the city for my paines.
Moreover, I that have always been clear and unspotted of crime, and
that have esteemed myne innocency above all the treasure of the world,
can finde no reasonable cause why upon myne accusation I should be
condemned to die, since first I was mooved to set upon the theeves by
just occasion. Secondly, because there is none that can affirm, that
there hath been at any time either grudge or hatred between us.
Thirdly, we were men meere strangers and of no acquaintance. Last of
all, no man can prove that I committed that fact for lucre or gaine.
When I had ended my words in this sort, behold, I weeped againe
pitteously, and holding up my hands I prayed all the people by the
mercy of the Commonweale and for the love of my poore infants and
children, to shew me some pitty and favour. And when their hearts were
somewhat relented and mooved by my lamentable teares, I called all the
gods to witnesse that I was unguilty of the crime, and so to their
divine providence, I committed my present estate, but turning my selfe
againe, I perceived that all the people laughed exceedingly, and
especially my good friend and host Milo. Then thought I with my selfe,
Alasse where is faith? Where is remorse of conscience? Behold I am
condemned to die as a murtherer, for the safeguard of myne Host Milo
and his family. Yet is he not contented with that, but likewise
laugheth me to scorne, when otherwise he should comfort and help mee.
THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was accused by two women, and how the slaine bodies were
found blowne bladders.
When this was done, out came a woman in the middle of the Theatre
arrayed in mourning vesture, and bearing a childe in her armes. And
after her came an old woman in ragged robes, crying and howling
likewise: and they brought with them the Olive boughs wherewith the
three slaine bodies were covered on the Beere, and cried out in this
manner: O right Judges, we pray by the justice and humanity which is in
you, to have mercy upon these slaine persons, and succour our Widowhood
and losse of our deare husbands, and especially this poore infant, who
is now an Orphan, and deprived of all good fortune: and execute your
justice by order and law, upon the bloud of this Theefe, who is the
occasion of all our sorrowes. When they had spoken these words, one of
the most antient Judges did rise and say, Touching this murther, which
deserveth great punishment, this malefactor himselfe cannot deny, but
our duty is to enquire and try out, whether he had Coadjutors to help
him. For it is not likely that one man alone could kill three such
great and valiant persons, wherefore the truth must be tried out by the
racke, and so wee shall learne what other companions he hath, and root
out the nest of these mischievous murtherers. And there was no long
delay, but according to the custome of Grecia, the fire, the wheele,
and many other torments were brought in. Then my sorrow encreased or
rather doubled, in that I could not end my life with whole and
unperished members. And by and by the old woman, who troubled all the
Court with her howling, desired the Judges, that before I should be
tormented on the racke, I might uncover the bodies which I had slaine,
that every man might see their comely shape and youthfull beauty, and
that I might receive condign and worthy punishment, according to the
quality of my offence: and therewithall shee made a sign of joy. Then
the Judge commanded me forthwith to discover the bodies of the slain,
lying upon the beere, with myne own handes, but when I refused a good
space, by reason I would not make my fact apparent to the eies of all
men, the Sergeant charged me by commandement of the Judges, and thrust
me forward to do the same. I being then forced by necessity, though it
were against my wil, uncovered the bodies: but O good Lord what a
strange sight did I see, what a monster? What sudden change of all my
sorrows? I seemed as though I were one of the house of Proserpina and
of the family of death, insomuch that I could not sufficiently expresse
the forme of this new sight, so far was I amased and astonied thereat:
for why, the bodies of the three slaine men were no bodies, but three
blown bladders mangled in divers places, and they seemed to be wounded
in those parts where I remembred I wounded the theeves the night
before. Whereat the people laughed exceedingly: some rejoyced
marvellously at the remembrance thereof, some held their stomackes that
aked with joy, but every man delighted at this passing sport, so passed
out of the theatre. But I from the time that I uncovered the bodies
stood stil as cold as ice, no otherwise than as the other statues and
images there, neither came I into my right senses, until such time as
Milo my Host came and tooke mee by the hand, and with civil violence
lead me away weeping and sobbing, whether I would or no. And because
that I might be seene, he brought me through many blind wayes and lanes
to his house, where he went about to comfort me, beeing sad and yet
fearfull, with gentle entreaty of talke. But he could in no wise
mitigate my impatiency of the injury which I conceived within my minde.
And behold, by and by the Magistrates and Judges with their ensignes
entred into the house, and endeavoured to pacify mee in this sort,
saying, O Lucius, we are advertised of your dignity, and know the
genealogie of your antient lineage, for the nobility of your Kinne doe
possesse the greatest part of all this Province: and thinke not that
you have suffered the thing wherfore you weepe, to any reproach and
ignominy, but put away all care and sorrow out of your minde. For this
day, which we celebrate once a yeare in honour of the god Risus, is
alwaies renowned with some solemne novel, and the god doth continually
accompany with the inventor therof, and wil not suffer that he should
be sorrowfull, but pleasantly beare a joyfull face. And verily all the
City for the grace that is in you, intend to reward you with great
honours, and to make you a Patron. And further that your statue or
image may be set up for a perpetuall remembrance.
To whome I answered, As for such benefits as I have received of the
famous City of Thessaly, I yeeld and render the most entire thanks, but
as touching the setting up of any statues or images, I would wish that
they should bee reserved for myne Auntients, and such as are more
worthy than I.
And when I had spoken these words somewhat gravely, and shewed my selfe
more merry than I was before, the Judges and magistrates departed, and
I reverently tooke my leave of them, and bid them farewell. And behold,
by and by there came one running unto me in haste, and sayd, Sir, your
cousin Byrrhena desireth you to take the paines according to your
promise yester night, to come to supper, for it is ready. But I greatly
fearing to goe any more to her house in the night, said to the
messenger, My friend I pray you tell to my cousine your mistresse, that
I would willingly be at her commandement, but for breaking my troth and
credit. For myne host Milo enforced me to assure him, and compelled me
by the feast of this present day, that I should not depart from his
company, wherefore I pray you to excuse, and to defer my promise to
another time.
And while I was speaking these words, Milo tooke me by the hand, and
led me towards the next Baine: but by the way I went couching under
him, to hide my selfe from the sight of men, because I had ministred
such an occasion of laughter. And when I had washed and wiped my selfe,
and returned home againe, I never remembred any such thing, so greatly
was I abashed at the nodding and pointing of every person. Then went I
to supper with Milo, where God wot we fared but meanly. Wherefore
feigning that my head did ake by reason of my sobbing and weeping all
day, I desired license to depart to my Chamber, and so I went to bed.
THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER
How Fotis told to Apuleius, what witchcraft her mistresse did use.
When I was a bed I began to call to minde all the sorrowes and griefes
that I was in the day before, until such time as my love Fotis, having
brought her mistresse to sleepe, came into the chamber, not as shee was
wont to do, for she seemed nothing pleasant neither in countenance nor
talke, but with sowre face and frowning looke, gan speak in this sort,
Verily I confesse that I have been the occasion of all thy trouble this
day, and therewith shee pulled out a whippe from under her apron, and
delivered it unto mee saying, Revenge thyself upon mee mischievous
harlot, or rather slay me.
And thinke you not that I did willingly procure this anguish and sorrow
unto you, I call the gods to witnesse. For I had rather myne owne body
to perish, than that you should receive or sustaine any harme by my
means, but that which I did was by the commandement of another, and
wrought as I thought for some other, but behold the unlucky chance
fortuned on you by my evill occasion.
Then I, very curious and desirous to know the matter, answered, In
faith (quoth I), this most pestilent and evill favoured whip which thou
hast brought to scourge thee withal, shal first be broken in a thousand
pieces, than it should touch or hurt thy delicate and dainty skin. But
I pray you tell me how have you been the cause and mean of my trouble
and sorrow? For I dare sweare by the love that I beare unto you, and I
will not be perswaded, though you your selfe should endeavour the same,
that ever you went to trouble or harm me: perhaps sometimes you
imagined an evil thought in your mind, which afterwards you revoked,
but that is not to bee deemed as a crime.
When I had spoken these words, I perceived by Fotis eys being wet with
tears and well nigh closed up that shee had a desire unto pleasure and
specially because shee embraced and kissed me sweetly. And when she was
somewhat restored unto joy shee desired me that shee might first shut
the chamber doore, least by the untemperance of her tongue, in uttering
any unfitting words, there might grow further inconvenience.
Wherewithall shee barred and propped the doore, and came to me againe,
and embracing me lovingly about the neck with both her armes, spake
with a soft voice and said, I doe greatly feare to discover the
privities of this house, and to utter the secret mysteries of my dame.
But I have such confidence in you and in your wisedome, by reason that
you are come of so noble a line, and endowed with so profound sapience,
and further instructed in so many holy and divine things, that you will
faithfully keepe silence, and that whatsoever I shall reveale or
declare unto you, you would close them within the bottome of your
heart, and never discover the same: for I ensure you, the love that I
beare unto you, enforceth mee to utter it. Now shal you know all the
estate of our house, now shal you know the hidden secrets of my
mistres, unto whome the powers of hel do obey, and by whom the
celestial planets are troubled, the gods made weake, and the elements
subdued, neither is the violence of her art in more strength and force,
than when she espieth some comly young man that pleaseth her fancie, as
oftentimes it hapneth, for now she loveth one Boetian a fair and
beautiful person, on whom she employes al her sorcerie and enchantment,
and I heard her say with mine own ears yester night, that if the Sun
had not then presently gon downe, and the night come to minister
convenient time to worke her magicall enticements, she would have
brought perpetuall darkness over all the world her selfe. And you shall
know, that when she saw yester night, this Boetian sitting at the
Barbers a polling, when she came from the Baines shee secretly
commanded me to gather up some of the haires of his head which lay
dispersed upon the ground, and to bring it home. Which when I thought
to have done the Barber espied me, and by reason it was bruited though
all the City that we were Witches and Enchantresses, he cried out and
said, Wil you never leave off stealing of young mens haires? In faith I
assure you, unlesse you cease your wicked sorceries, I will complaine
to the Justices. Wherewithall he came angerly towards me, and tooke
away the haire which I had gathered, out of my apron: which grieved me
very much, for I knew my Mistresses manners, that she would not be
contented but beat me cruelly.
Wherefore I intended to runne away, but the remembrance of you put
alwayes the thought out of my minde, and so I came homeward very
sorrowful: but because I would not seeme to come to my mistresse sight
with empty hands, I saw a man shearing of blowne goat skinnes, and the
hayre which he had shorne off was yellow, and much resembled the haire
of the Boetian, and I tooke a good deale thereof, and colouring of the
matter, I brought it to my mistresse. And so when night came, before
your returne from supper, she to bring her purpose to passe, went up to
a high Gallery of her house, opening to the East part of the world, and
preparing her selfe according to her accustomed practise, shee gathered
together all substance for fumigations, she brought forth plates of
mettal carved with strange characters, she prepared the bones of such
as were drowned by tempest in the seas, she made ready the members of
dead men, as the nosethrils and fingers, shee set out the lumps of
flesh of such as were hanged, the blood which she had reserved of such
as were slaine and the jaw bones and teeth of willed beasts, then she
said certaine charmes over the haire, and dipped it in divers waters,
as in Wel water, Cow milk, mountain honey, and other liquor. Which when
she had done, she tied and lapped it up together, and with many
perfumes and smells threw it into an hot fire to burn. Then by the
great force of this sorcerie, and the violence of so many confections,
those bodies whose haire was burning in the fire, received humane
shape, and felt, heard and walked: And smelling the sent of their owne
haire, came and rapped at our doores in stead of Boetius. Then you
being well tipled, and deceived by the obscurity of the night, drew out
your sword courageously like furious Ajax, and kild not as he did,
whole heard of beastes, but three blowne skinnes, to the intent that I,
after the slaughter of so many enemies, without effusion of bloud might
embrace and kisse, not an homicide but an Utricide.
Thus when I was pleasantly mocked and taunted by Fotis, I sayd unto
her, verily now may I for this atcheived enterprise be numbered as
Hercules, who by his valiant prowesse performed the twelve notable
Labors, as Gerion with three bodies, and as Cerberus with three heads,
for I have slaine three blown goat skinnes. But to the end that I may
pardon thee of that thing which thou hast committed, perform, the thing
which I most earnestly desire of thee, that is, bring me that I may see
and behold when thy mistresse goeth about any Sorcery or enchantment,
and when she prayeth unto the gods: for I am very desirous to learne
that art, and as it seemeth unto mee, thou thy selfe hath some
experience in the same. For this I know and plainly feele, That whereas
I have always yrked and loathed the embrace of Matrones, I am so
stricken and subdued with thy shining eyes, ruddy cheekes, glittering
haire, sweet cosses, and lilly white paps, that I have neither minde to
goe home, nor to depart hence, but esteeme the pleasure which I shall
have with thee this night, above all the joyes of the world. Then
(quoth she) O my Lucius, how willing would I be to fulfil your desire,
but by reason shee is so hated, she getteth her selfe into solitary
places, and out of the presence of every person, when she mindeth to
work her enchantments. Howbeit I regarde more to gratify your request,
than I doe esteeme the danger of my life: and when I see opportunitie
and time I will assuredly bring you word, so that you shal see all her
enchantments, but always upon this condition, that you secretly keepe
close such things as are done.
Thus as we reasoned together the courage of Venus assailed, as well our
desires as our members, and so she unrayed herself and came to bed, and
we passed the night in pastime and dalliance, till as by drowsie and
unlusty sleep I was constrained to lie still.
THE SIXTEENTH CHAPTER
How Fotis brought Apuleius to see her Mistresse enchant.
On a day Fotis came running to me in great feare, and said that her
mistresse, to work her sorceries on such as shee loved, intended the
night following to transforme her selfe into a bird, and to fly whither
she pleased. Wherefore she willed me privily to prepare my selfe to see
the same. And when midnight came she led me softly into a high chamber,
and bid me look thorow the chink of a doore: where first I saw how shee
put off all her garments, and took out of a certain coffer sundry
kindes of Boxes, of the which she opened one, and tempered the ointment
therein with her fingers, and then rubbed her body therewith from the
sole of the foot to the crowne of the head, and when she had spoken
privily with her selfe, having the candle in her hand, she shaked the
parts of her body, and behold, I perceived a plume of feathers did
burgen out, her nose waxed crooked and hard, her nailes turned into
clawes, and so she became an Owle. Then she cried and screeched like a
bird of that kinde, and willing to proove her force, mooved her selfe
from the ground by little and little, til at last she flew quite away.
Thus by her sorcery shee transformed her body into what shape she
would. Which when I saw I was greatly astonied: and although I was
inchanted by no kind of charme, yet I thought that I seemed not to have
the likenesse of Lucius, for so was I banished from my sences, amazed
in madnesse, and so I dreamed waking, that I felt myne eyes, whether I
were asleepe or no. But when I was come againe to my selfe, I tooke
Fotis by the hand, and moved it to my face and said, I pray thee while
occasion doth serve, that I may have the fruition of the fruits of my
desire, and grant me some of this oyntment. O Fotis I pray thee by thy
sweet paps, to make that in the great flames of my love I may be turned
into a bird, so I will ever hereafter be bound unto you, and obedient
to your commandement. Then said Fotis, Wil you go about to deceive me
now, and inforce me to work my own sorrow? Are you in the mind that you
will not tarry in Thessaly? If you be a bird, where shall I seek you,
and when shall I see you? Then answered I, God forbid that I should
commit such a crime, for though I could fly in the aire as an Eagle or
though I were the messenger of Jupiter, yet would I have recourse to
nest with thee: and I swear by the knot of thy amiable hair, that since
the time I first loved thee, I never fancied any other person:
moreover, this commeth to my minde, that if by the vertue of the
oyntment I shall become an Owle, I will take heed I will come nigh no
mans house: for I am not to learn, how these matrons would handle their
lovers, if they knew that they were transformed into Owles: Moreover,
when they are taken in any place they are nayled upon posts, and so
they are worthily rewarded, because it is thought that they bring evill
fortune to the house. But I pray you (which I had almost forgotten) to
tell me by what meanes when I am an Owle, I shall return to my pristine
shape, and become Lucius againe. Feare not (quoth she) for my mistres
hath taught me the way to bring that to passe, neither thinke you that
she did it for any good will and favour, but to the end that I might
help her, and minister some remedy when she returneth home.
Consider I pray you with your selfe, with what frivolous trifles so
marvellous a thing is wrought: for by Hercules I swear I give her
nothing else save a little Dill and Lawrell leaves, in Well water, the
which she drinketh and washeth her selfe withall. Which when she had
spoken she went into the chamber and took a box out of the coffer,
which I first kissed and embraced, and prayed that I might [have] good
successe in my purpose. And then I put off all my garments, and
greedily thrust my hand into the box, and took out a good deale of
oyntment and rubbed my selfe withall.
THE SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius thinking to be turned into a Bird, was turned into an
Asse, and how he was led away by Theves.
After that I had well rubbed every part and member of my body, I
hovered with myne armes, and moved my selfe, looking still when I
should bee changed into a Bird as Pamphiles was, and behold neither
feathers nor appearance of feathers did burgen out, but verily my haire
did turne in ruggednesse, and my tender skin waxed tough and hard, my
fingers and toes losing the number of five, changed into hoofes, and
out of myne arse grew a great taile, now my face became monstrous, my
nosthrils wide, my lips hanging downe, and myne eares rugged with
haire: neither could I see any comfort of my transformation, for my
members encreased likewise, and so without all helpe (viewing every
part of my poore body) I perceived that I was no bird, but a plaine
Asse.
Then I thought to blame Fotis, but being deprived as wel of language as
of humane shape, I looked upon her with my hanging lips and watery
eyes. Who as soon as shee espied me in such sort, cried out, Alas poore
wretch that I am, I am utterly cast away. The feare I was in, and my
haste hath beguiled me, but especially the mistaking of the box, hath
deceived me. But it forceth not much, in regard a sooner medicine may
be gotten for this than for any other thing. For if thou couldst get a
rose and eat it, thou shouldst be delivered from the shape of an Asse,
and become my Lucius againe. And would to God I had gathered some
garlands this evening past, according to my custome, then thou shouldst
not continue an Asse one nights space, but in the morning I shall seek
some remedy. Thus Fotis lamented in pittifull sort, but I that was now
a perfect asse, and for Lucius a brute beast, did yet retaine the sence
and understanding of a man. And did devise a good space with my selfe,
whether it were best for me to teare this mischievous and wicked harlot
with my mouth, or to kicke and kill her with my heels. But a better
thought reduced me from so rash a purpose: for I feared lest by the
death of Fotis I should be deprived of all remedy and help. Then
shaking myne head, and dissembling myne ire, and taking my adversity in
good part, I went into the stable to my owne horse, where I found
another asse of Milos, somtime my host, and I did verily think that
mine owne horse (if there were any natural conscience or knowledge in
brute beasts) would take pitty on me, and profer me lodging for that
night: but it chanced far otherwise. For see, my horse and the asse as
it were consented together to work my harm, and fearing lest I should
eat up their provender, would in no wise suffer me to come nigh the
manger, but kicked me with their heels from their meat, which I my self
gave them the night before. Then I being thus handled by them, and
driven away, got me into a corner of the stable, where while I
remembred their uncurtesie, and how on the morrow I should return to
Lucius by the help of a Rose, when as I thought to revenge my selfe of
myne owne horse, I fortuned to espy in the middle of a pillar
sustaining the rafters of the stable the image of the goddesse Hippone,
which was garnished and decked round about with faire and fresh roses:
then in hope of present remedy, I leaped up with my fore feet as high
as I could, stretching out my neck, and with my lips coveting to snatch
some roses. But in an evill houre I did go about that enterprise, for
behold the boy to whom I gave charge of my horse, came presently in,
and finding me climbing upon the pillar, ranne fretting towards me and
said, How long shall wee suffer this wild Asse, that doth not onely eat
up his fellowes meat, but also would spoyl the images of the gods? Why
doe I not kill this lame theefe and weake wretch? And therewithall
looking about for some cudgel, hee espied where lay a fagot of wood,
and chusing out a crabbed truncheon of the biggest hee could finde, did
never cease beating of mee poore wretch, until such time as by great
noyse and rumbling, hee heard the doores of the house burst open, and
the neighbours crying in most lamentable sort, which enforced him being
stricken in feare, to fly his way. And by and by a troupe of theeves
entred in, and kept every part and corner of the house with weapons.
And as men resorted to aid and help them which were within the doores,
the theeves resisted and kept them back, for every man was armed with a
sword and target in his hand, the glimpses whereof did yeeld out such
light as if it had bin day. Then they brake open a great chest with
double locks and bolts, wherein was layd all the treasure of Milo, and
ransackt the same: which when they had done they packed it up and gave
every man a portion to carry: but when they had more than they could
beare away, yet were they loth to leave any behind, but came into the
stable, and took us two poore asses and my horse, and laded us with
greater trusses than wee were able to beare. And when we were out of
the house, they followed us with great staves, and willed one of their
fellows to tarry behind, and bring them tydings what was done
concerning the robbery: and so they beat us forward over great hils out
of the way. But I, what with my heavy burden and long journy, did
nothing differ from a dead asse: wherfore I determined with my self to
seek some civil remedy, and by invocation of the name of the prince of
the country to be delivered from so many miseries: and on a time I
passed through a great faire, I came among a multitude of Greeks, and I
thought to call upon the renowned name of the Emperor and say, O Cesar,
and cried out aloud O, but Cesar I could in no wise pronounce. The
Theeves little regarding my crying, did lay me on and beat my wretched
skinne in such sort, that after it was neither apt nor meet to make
Sives or Sarces. Howbeit at last Jupiter administred to me an unhoped
remedy. For when we had passed through many townes and villages, I
fortuned to espy a pleasant garden, wherein beside many other flowers
of delectable hiew, were new and fresh roses: and being very joyful,
and desirous to catch some as I passed by, I drew neerer and neerer:
and while my lips watered upon them, I thought of a better advice more
profitable for me, lest if from an asse I should become a man, I might
fall into the hands of the theeves, and either by suspition that I were
some witch, or for feare that I should utter their theft, I should be
slaine, wherefore I abstained for that time from eating of Roses, and
enduring my present adversity, I did eat hay as other Asses did.
THE FOURTH BOOKE
THE EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius thinking to eat Roses, was cruelly beaten by a Gardener,
and chased by dogs.
When noone was come, that the broyling heate of the sunne had most
power, we turned into a village to certaine of the theeves acquaintance
and friends, for verily their meeting and embracing together did give
me, poore asse, cause to deeme the same, and they tooke the trusse from
my backe, and gave them part of the Treasure which was in it, and they
seemed to whisper and tell them that it was stollen goods, and after
that we were unladen of our burthens, they let us loose in a medow to
pasture, but myne own horse and Miloes Asse would not suffer me to feed
there with them, but I must seeke my dinner in some other place.
Wherefore I leaped into a garden which was behinde the stable, and
being well nigh perished with hunger, although I could find nothing
there but raw and green fallets, yet I filled my hungry guts
therwithall abundantly, and praying unto all the gods, I looked about
in every place if I could espy any red roses in the gardens by, and my
solitary being alone did put me in good hope, that if I could find any
remedy, I should presently of an Asse be changed into Lucius out of
every mans sight. And while I considered these things, I loked about,
and behold I saw a farre off a shadowed valley adjoyning nigh unto a
wood, where amongst divers other hearbes and pleasant verdures, me
thought I saw bright flourishing Roses of bright damaske colour; and
said within my bestaill minde, Verily that place is the place of Venus
and the Graces, where secretly glistereth the royall hew, of so lively
and delectable a floure. Then I desiring the help of the guide of my
good fortune, ranne lustily towards the wood, insomuch that I felt
myself that I was no more an Asse, but a swift coursing horse: but my
agility and quicknes could not prevent the cruelty of my fortune, for
when I came to the place I perceived that they were no roses, neither
tender nor pleasant, neither moystened with the heavenly drops of dew,
nor celestial liquor, which grew out of the thicket and thornes there.
Neither did I perceive that there was any valley at all, but onely the
bank of the river, environed with great thick trees, which had long
branches like unto lawrell, and bearing a flour without any manner of
sent, and the common people call them by the name of Lawrel roses,
which be very poyson to all manner of beasts. Then was I so intangled
with unhappy fortune that I little esteemed mine own danger, and went
willingly to eat of these roses, though I knew them to be present
poyson: and as I drew neere I saw a yong man that seemed to be the
gardener, come upon mee, and when he perceived that I had devoured all
his hearbes in the garden, he came swearing with a great staffe in his
hand, and laid upon me in such sort, that I was well nigh dead, but I
speedily devised some remedy my self, for I lift up my legs and kicked
him with my hinder heels, that I left him lying at the hill foot wel
nigh slain, and so I ran away. Incontinently came out his wife, who
seeing her husband halfe dead, cried and howled in pittifull sort, and
went toward her husband, to the intent that by her lowd cries shee
might purchase to me present destruction. Then all the persons of the
town, moved by her noise came forth, and cried for dogs to teare me
down. Out came a great company of Bandogs and mastifes, more fit to pul
down bears and lions than me, whom when I beheld I thought verily I
should presently die: but I turned myself about, and ranne as fast as
ever I might to the stable from whence I came. Then the men of the
towne called in their dogs, and took me and bound mee to the staple of
a post, and scourged me with a great knotted whip till I was well nigh
dead, and they would undoubtedly have slaine me, had it not come to
passe, that what with the paine of their beating, and the greene
hearbes that lay in my guts, I caught such a laske that I all
besprinkled their faces with my liquid dung, and enforced them to leave
off.
THE NINETEENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was prevented of his purpose, and how the Theeves came to
their den.
Not long after, the theeves laded us againe, but especially me, and
brought us forth of the stable, and when wee had gone a good part of
our journey what with the long way, my great burthen, the beating of
staves, and my worne hooves, I was so weary that I could scantly go.
Then I saw a little before mee a river running with fair water, and I
said to myself, Behold, now I have found a good occasion: for I will
fall down when I come yonder, and surely I will not rise againe,
neither with scourging nor with beating, for I had rather be slaine
there presently, than goe any further.
And the cause why I had determined so to doe was this, I thought that
the theeves when they did see me so feeble and weake that I could not
travell, to the intent they would not stay in their journey, they would
take the burthen from my backe and put it on my fellowes, and so for my
further punishment to leave me as a prey to the wolves and ravening
beasts. But evill fortune prevented so good a consideration; for the
other Asse being of the same purpose that I was of, by feigned and
coloured wearinesse fell downe first, with all his burthen on the
ground as though hee were dead, and he would not rise neither with
beating nor with pricking, nor stand upon his legs, though they pulled
him by the tail, by his legs, and by his eares: which when the theeves
beheld, as without all hope they said one unto another, What should we
stand here so long about a dead or rather a stony asse? let us bee
gone: and so they tooke his burthen, and divided some to mee, and some
to my horse. And then they drew out their swords and cut off his legs,
and threw his body from the point of a hill down into a great valley.
Then I considering with my selfe of the evill fortune of my poore
companion, and purposed now to forget all subtility and deceit, and to
play the good Asse to get my masters favour, for I perceived by their
talke that we were come home well nigh at our journeys end. And after
that wee had passed over a little hill, we came to our appointed place,
and when we were unladen of our burthens, and all things carried in, I
tumbled and wallowed in the dust, to refresh my selfe in stead of
water. The thing and the time compelleth me to make description of the
places, and especially of the den where the theeves did inhabit, I will
prove my wit in what I can doe, and the consider you whether I was an
Asse in judgement and sence, or no. For first there was an exceeding
great hill compassed about with big trees very high, with many turning
bottoms full of sharp stones, whereby it was inaccessible. There was
many winding and hollow vallies, environed with thickets and thornes,
and naturally fortressed round about. From the top of the hill ranne a
running water as cleare as silver, that watered all the valleyes below,
that it seemed like unto a sea inclosed, or a standing floud. Before
the denne where was no hill stood an high tower, and at the foot
thereof were sheep-coats fenced and walled with clay. Before the gate
of the house were pathes made in stead of wals, in such sort that you
could easily judge it to be a very den for theeves, and there was
nothing else except a little coat covered with thatch, wherein the
theeves did nightly accustome to watch by order, as I after perceived.
And when they were all crept into the house, and we were all tied fast
with halters at the dore, they began to chide with an old woman there,
crooked with age, who had the government and rule of all the house, and
said, How is it old witch, old trot, and strumpet, that thou sittest
idley all day at home, and having no regard to our perillous labours,
hast provided nothing for our suppers, but sittest eating and swilling
thyself from morning till night? Then the old woman trembled, and
scantly able to speak gan say, Behold my puissant and faithfull
masters, you shall have meat and pottage enough by and by: here is
first store of bread, wine plenty, filled in cleane rinsed pots,
likewise here is hot water prepared to bathe you.
Which when she had said, they put off all their garments and refreshed
themselves by the fire. And after they were washed and noynted with
oyle, they sate downe at the table garnished with all kind of dainty
meats. They were no sooner sate downe, but in came another company of
yong men more in number than was before, who seemed likewise to bee
Theeves, for they brought in their preyes of gold and silver, Plate,
jewels, and rich robes, and when they had likewise washed, they sate
among the rest, and served one another by order. Then they drank and
eat exceedingly, laughing, crying and making much noyse, that I thought
that I was among the tyrannous and wilde Lapithes, Thebans, and
Centaures. At length one of them more valiant than the rest, spake in
this sort, We verily have manfully conquered the house of Milo of
Hippata, and beside all the riches and treasure which by force we have
brought away, we are all come home safe, and are increased the more by
this horse and this Asse. But you that have roved about in the country
of Boetia, have lost your valiante captaine Lamathus, whose life I more
regarded than all the treasure which you have brought: and therfore the
memory of him shall bee renowned for ever amongst the most noble kings
and valiant captains: but you accustome when you goe abroad, like men
with ganders hearts to creepe through every corner and hole for every
trifle. Then one of them that came last answered, Why are you only
ignorant, that the greater the number is, the sooner they may rob and
spoyle the house? And although the family be dispersed in divers
lodgings, yet every man had rather to defend his own life, than to save
the riches of his master: but when there be but a few theeves, then
will they not only rather regard themselves, but also their substance,
how little or great soever it be. And to the intent you may beleeve me
I will shew you an example: wee were come nothing nigh to Thebes, where
is the fountain of our art and science, but we learned where a rich
Chuffe called Chriseros did dwell, who for fear of offices in the
publique wel dissembled his estate, and lived sole and solitary in a
small coat, howbeit replenished with aboundance of treasure, and went
daily in ragged and torn apparel. Wherefore wee devised with our selves
to go to his house and spoyl him of all his riches. And when night came
we drew towards the dore, which was so strongly closed, that we could
neither move it, nor lift it out of the hooks, and we thought it best
not to break it open lest by the noyse we should raise up to our harm
the neighbours by. Then our strong and valiant captaine Lamathus
trusting in his own strength and force, thrust in his hand through a
hole in the dore, and thought to pull back the bolt: but the covetous
caitif Chriseros being awake, and making no noise came softly to the
dore and caught his hand and with a great naile nailed it fast to the
post: which when he had done, he ran up to the high chamber and called
every one of his neighbours by name, desiring them to succour him with
all possible speed, for his own house was on fire. Then every one for
fear of his owne danger came running out to aid him, wherewith we
fearing our present peril, knew not what was best to be don, whether
wee should leave our companion there, or yeeld ourselves to die with
him: but we by his consent devised a better way, for we cut off his arm
by the elbow and so let it hang there: then wee bound his wound with
clouts, lest we should be traced by the drops of blood: which don we
took Lamathus and led him away, for fear we would be taken: but being
so nigh pursued that we were in present danger, and that Lamathus could
not keepe our company by reason of faintnesse; and on the other side
perceiving that it was not for his profit to linger behinde, he spake
unto us as a man of singular courage and vertue, desiring us by much
entreaty and prayer and by the puissance of the god Mars, and the faith
of our confederacy, to deliver his body from torment and miserable
captivity: and further he said, How is it possible that so courageous a
Captaine can live without his hand, wherewith he could somtime rob and
slay so many people? I would thinke myself sufficiently happy if I
could be slaine by one of you. But when he saw that we all refused to
commit any such fact, he drew out his sword with his other hand, and
after that he had often kissed it, he drove it clean through his body.
Then we honoured the corps of so puissant a man, and wrapped it in
linnen cloathes and threw it into the sea. So lieth our master
Lamathus, buried and did in the grave of water, and ended his life as I
have declared. But Alcinus, though he were a man of great enterprise,
yet could he not beware by Lamathus, nor voide himselfe from evill
fortune, for on a day when he had entred into an old womans house to
rob her, he went up into a high chamber, where hee should first have
strangled her: but he had more regard to throw down the bags of mony
and gold out at a window, to us that stood under; and when he was so
greedy that he would leave nothing behinde, he went into the old womans
bed where she lay asleep, and would have taken off the coverlet to have
thrown downe likewise, but shee awaked, and kneeling on her knees,
desired him in this manner: O sir I pray you cast not away such torn
and ragged clouts into my neighbours houses, for they are rich enough,
and need no such things. Then Alcinus thinking her words to be true,
was brought in beleefe, that such things as he had throwne out already,
and such things as hee should throw out after, was not fallen downe to
his fellowes, but to other mens houses, wherefore hee went to the
window to see, and as hee thought to behold the places round about,
thrusting his body out of the window, the old woman marked him wel, and
came behind him softly, and though shee had but small strength, yet
with sudden force she tooke him by the heeles and thrust him out
headlong, and so he fell upon a marvellous great stone and burst his
ribs, wherby he vomited and spewed great flakes of blood, and presently
died. Then wee threw him to the river likewise, as we had done Lamathus
before.
When we had thus lost two of our companions, we liked not Thebes, but
marched towards the next city called Platea, where we found a man of
great fame called Demochares, that purposed to set forth a great game,
where should be a triall of all kind of weapons: hee was come of a good
house, marvellous rich, liberall, and wel deserved that which he had
and had prepared many showes and pleasures for the Common people,
insomuch that there is no man can either by wit or eloquence shew in
words his worthy preparations: for first he had provided all sorts of
armes, hee greatly delighted in hunting and chasing, he ordained great
towers and Tables to move hither and thither: hee made many places to
chase and encounter in: he had ready a great number of men and wilde
beasts, and many condemned persons were brought from the Judgement
place, to try and fight with those beasts. But amongst so great
preparations of noble price, he bestowed the most part of his patrimony
in buying of Beares, which he nourished to his great cost, and esteemed
more than all the other beasts, which either by chasing hee caught
himself, or which he dearely bought, or which were given him from
divers of his friends.
Howbeit for all his sumptuous cost, hee could not be free from the
malitious eyes of envy, for some of them were well nigh dead with too
long tying up, some meagre with the broyling heat of the sunne, some
languished with lying, but all having sundry diseases, were so
afflicted that they died one after another, and there was well nigh
none left, in such sort that you might see them lying in the streets
pittiously dead. And the common people having no other meat to feed on,
little regarding any curiosity, would come forth and fill their bellies
with the flesh of the beares. Then by and by Babulus and I devised a
pretty sport, wee drew one of the greatest of the Beares to our
lodging, as though wee would prepare to eat thereof, where wee flayed
of his skinne, and kept his ungles whole, but we medled not with the
head, but cut it off by the necke, and so let it hang to the skinne.
Then we rased off the flesh from the necke, and cast dust thereon, and
set it in the sun to dry.
THE TWENTIETH CHAPTER
How Thrasileon was disguised in a Beares skin, and how he was handled.
When the skin was a drying we made merry with the flesh, and then we
devised with our selves, that one of us being more valiant than the
rest both in body and courage (so that he would consent thereto) should
put on the skin, and feigning that he were a Beare, should be led to
Demochares house in the night, by which means we thought to be received
and let in. Many were desirous to play the Beare, but especially one
Thrasileon of a couragious minde would take this enterprise in hand.
Then wee put in into the Beares skin, which him finely in every point,
wee buckled it fast under his belly, and covered the seam with the
haire, that it might not be seen. After this we made little holes
through the bears head, and through his nosthrils and eyes, for
Thrasileon to see out and take wind at, in such sort that he seemed a
very lively and natural beast: when this was don we went into a cave
which we hired for the purpose, and he crept in after like a bear with
a good courage. Thus we began our subtility, and then wee imagined
thus, wee feigned letters as though they came from one Nicanor which
dwelt in the Country of Thracia, which was of great acquaintance with
this Demochares, wherein we wrote, that hee had sent him being his
friend, the first fruits of his coursing and hunting. When night was
come, which was a meet time for our purpose, we brought Thrasileon and
our forged letters and presented them to Demochares. When Demochares
beheld this mighty Beare, and saw the liberality of Nicanor his friend,
hee commanded his servants to deliver unto us x. crowns, having great
store in his coffers. Then (as the novelty of a thing doth accustom to
stir mens minds to behold the same) many persons came on every side to
see this bear: but Thrasileon, lest they should by curious viewing and
prying perceive the truth, ran upon them to put them in feare that they
durst not come nigh. The people said, Verily Demochares is right happy,
in that after the death of so many beasts, hee hath gotten maugre
fortunes head, so goodly a bear. Then Demochares commanded him with all
care to be put in the park with all the other beasts: but immediately I
spake unto him and said, Sir I pray you take heed how you put a beast
tired with the heat of the sun and with long travell, among others
which as I hear say have divers maladies and diseases, let him rather
lie in some open place in your house nie some water, where he may take
air and ease himself, for doe you not know that such kind of beasts do
greatly delight to couch under the shadow of trees and hillocks neer
pleasant wells and waters? Hereby Demochares admonished, and remembring
how many he had before that perished, was contented that we should put
the bear where we would. Moreover we said unto him, that we ourselves
were determined to lie all night neer the Bear, to look unto him, and
to give him meat and drink at his due houre.
Then he answered, Verily masters you need not put yourselves to such
paines, for I have men that serve for nothing but that purpose. So wee
tooke leave of him and departed: and when we were come without the
gates of the town, we perceived before us a great sepulchre standing
out of the highway in a privy and secret place, and thither we went and
opened the mouth thereof, whereas we found the sides covered with the
corruption of man, and the ashes and dust of his long buried body,
wherein we got ourselves to bring our purpose to passe, and having
respect to the dark time of night, according to our custome, when we
thought that every one was asleepe, we went with our weapons and
besieged the house of Demochares round about. Then Thrasileon was ready
at hand, and leaped out of the caverne, and went to kill all such as he
found asleepe: but when he came to the Porter, he opened the gates and
let us in, and then he shewed us a large Counter, wherein we saw the
night before a great aboundance of treasure: which when by violence we
had broke open, I bid every one of my fellows take as much gold and
silver as they could carry away: and beare it to the sepulchre, and
still as they carried away I stood at the gate, watching diligently
when they would returne. The Beare running about the house, to make
such of the family afeared as fortuned to wake and come out. For who is
he that is so puissant and couragious, that at the ougly sight of so
great a monster will not quayle and keep his chamber especially in the
night? But when wee had brought this matter to so good a point, there
chanced a pittifull case, for as I looked for my companions that should
come from the sepulchre, behold there was a Boy of the house that
fortuned to looke out of a window, and espied the Bear running about,
and he went and told all the servants of the house. Whereupon
incontinently they came forth with Torches, Lanthornes, and other
lights, that they might see all the yard over: they came with clubs,
speares, naked swords, Greyhounds, and Mastifes to slay the poore
beast. Then I during this broyle thought to run away, but because I
would see Thrasileon fight with the Dogs, I lay behinde the gate to
behold him. And although I might perceive that he was well nigh dead,
yet remembred he his owne faithfulnes and ours, and valiantly resisted
the gaping and ravenous mouths of the hell hounds, so tooke hee in gree
the pagiant which willingly he tooke in hand himself, and with much
adoe tumbled at length out of the house: but when hee was at liberty
abroad yet could he not save himself, for all the dogs of the Streete
joyned themselves to the greyhounds and mastifes of the house, and came
upon him.
Alas what a pittifull sight it was to see our poore Thrasileon thus
environed and compassed with so many dogs that tare and rent him
miserably. Then I impatient of so great a misery, ranne in among the
prease of people, and ayding him with my words as much as I might,
exhorted them all in this manner: O great and extreame mischance, what
a pretious and excellent beast have we lost. But my words did nothing
prevaile, for there came out a tall man with a speare in his hand, that
thrust him cleane through, and afterwards many that stood by drew out
their swords, and so they killed him. But verily our good Captaine
Thrasileon, the honour of our comfort, received his death so patiently,
that he would not bewray the league betweene us, either by crying,
howling, or any other meanes, but being torn with dogs and wounded with
weapons, did yeeld forth a dolefull cry, more like unto a beast than a
man. And taking his present fortune in good part, with courage and
glory enough did finish his life, with such a terror unto the assembly,
that no person was hardy until it was day, as to touch him, though hee
were starke dead: but at last there came a Butcher more valiant than
the rest, who opening the panch of the beast, slit out an hardy and
ventrous theefe.
In this manner we lost our Captain Thrasileon, but he left not his fame
and honour.
When this was done wee packed up our treasure, which we committed to
the sepulchre to keepe, and got out of the bounds of Platea, thus
thinking with our selves, that there was more fidelity amongst the dead
than amongst the living, by reason that our preyes were so surely kept
in the sepulchre. So being wearied with the weight of our burthens, and
well nigh tyred with long travell, having lost three of our soldiers,
we are come home with these present cheats.
Thus when they had spoken in memory of their slaine companions, they
tooke cups of gold, and sung hymns unto the god mars, and layd them
downe to sleep. Then the old woman gave us fresh barley without
measure, insomuch that my horse fed so abundantly that he might well
thinke hee was at some banquet that day. But I that was accustomed to
eat bran and flower, thought that but a sower kinde of meate. Wherfore
espying a corner where lay loaves of bread for all the house I got me
thither and filled my hungry guts therewith.
THE TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER
How the Theeves stole away a Gentlewoman, and brought her to their den.
When night was come the Theeves awaked and rose up, and when they had
buckled on their weapons, and disguised their faces with visards, they
departed. And yet for all the great sleep that came upon me, I could in
no wise leave eating: and whereas when I was a man I could be contented
with one or two loaves at the most, now my huts were so greedy that
three panniers full would scantly serve me, and while I considered
these things the morning came, and being led to a river,
notwithstanding my Assie shamefastnesse I quencht my thirst. And
suddenly after, the Theeves returned home carefull and heavy, bringing
no burthens with them, no not so much as traffe or baggage, save only a
maiden, that seemed by her habit to be some gentlewoman borne, and the
daughter of some worthy matron of that country, who was so fair and
beautiful, that though I were an Asse, yet I had a great affection for
her. The virgin lamented and tare her hair, and rent her garments, for
the great sorrow she was in; but the theeves brought her within the
cave, and assisted her to comfort in this sort, Weep not fair
gentlewoman we pray you, for be you assured we wil do no outrage or
violence to your person: but take patience a while for our profit, for
necessity and poore estate hath compelled us to do this enterprise: we
warrant you that your parents, although they bee covetous, will be
contented to give us a great quantity of mony to redeeme and ransome
you from our hands.
With such and like flattering words they endeavoured to appease the
gentlewoman, howbeit shee would in no case be comforted, but put her
head betwixt her knees, and cried pittiously. Then they called the old
woman, and commaunded her to sit by the maiden, and pacify her dolor as
much as shee might. And they departed away to rob, as they were
accustomed to doe, but the virgin would not asswage her griefes, nor
mitigate her sorrow by any entreaty of the old woman, but howled and
sobbed in such sort, that she made me poore Asse likewise to weepe, and
thus she said, Alas can I poore wench live any longer, that am come of
so good a house, forsaken of my parents, friends, and family, made a
rapine and prey, closed servilely in this stony prison, deprived of all
pleasure, wherein I have been brought up, thrown in danger, ready to be
rent in pieces among so many sturdy theeves and dreadful robbers, can I
(I say) cease from weeping, and live any longer? Thus she cried and
lamented, and after she had wearied herself with sorrow and blubbered
her face with teares, she closed the windowes of her hollow eyes, and
laid her downe to sleepe. And after that she had slept, she rose again
like a furious and mad woman, and beat her breast and comely face more
that she did before.
Then the old woman enquired the causes of her new and sudden
lamentation. To whom sighing in pittifull sort she answered, Alas now I
am utterly undone, now am I out of all hope, O give me a knife to kill
me, or a halter to hang me. Whereat the old [woman] was more angry, and
severely commanded her to tell her the cause of her sorrow, and why
after her sleep, she should renew her dolour and miserable weeping.
What, thinke you (quoth she) to deprive our young men of the price of
your ransome? No, no therefore cease your crying, for the Theeves doe
little esteeme your howling, and if you do not, I will surely burn you
alive. Hereat the maiden was greatly feared, and kissed her hand and
said, O mother take pitty upon me and my wretched fortune, and give me
license a while to speake, for I think I shall not long live, let there
be mercy ripe and franke in thy venerable hoare head, and hear the sum
of my calamity.
There was a comely young man, who for his bounty and grace was beloved
entirely of all the towne, my cousine Germane, and but three years
older than I; we two were nourished and brought up in one house, lay
under one roofe, and in one chamber, and at length by promise of
marriage, and by consent of our parents we were contracted together.
The marriage day was come, the house was garnished with lawrel, and
torches were set in every place in the honour of Hymeneus, my espouse
was accompanied by his parents, kinsfolke, and friends, and made
sacrifices in the temples and publique places. And when my unhappy
mother pampered me in her lap, and decked me like a bride, kissing me
sweetly, and making me a parent for Children, behold there came in a
great multitude of theeves armed like men of warre, with naked swords
in their hands, who went not about to doe any harme, neither to take
any thing away, but brake into the chamber where I was, and violently
tooke me out of my mothers armes, when none of our family would resist
for feare.
In this sort was our marriage disturbed, like the marriage of Hyppodame
and Perithous. But behold my good mother, now my unhappy fortune is
renewed and encreased: For I dreamed in my sleepe, that I was pulled
out of our house, out of our chamber, and out of my bed, and that I
removed about in solitary and unknowne places, calling upon the name of
my unfortunate husband, and how that he, as soone as he perceived that
he was taken away, even smelling with perfumes and crowned with
garlands, did trace me by the steppes, desiring the aid of the people
to assist him, in that his wife was violently stollen away, and as he
went crying up and down, one of the theeves mooved with indignation, by
reason of his pursuit, took up a stone that lay at his feet, and threw
it at my husband and killed him. By the terror of which sight, and the
feare of so dreadfull a dreame, I awaked.
Then the old woman rendring out like sighes, began to speake in this
sort: My daughter take a good heart unto you, and bee not afeared at
feigned and strange visions and dreams, for as the visions of the day
are accounted false and untrue, so the visions of the night doe often
change contrary. And to dream of weeping, beating, and killing, is a
token of good luck and prosperous change. Whereas contrary to dreame of
laughing, carnal dalliance, and good cheere, is a signe of sadnesse,
sicknesse, loss of substance, and displeasure. But I will tell thee a
pleasant tale, to put away all thy sorrow, and to revive thy spirits.
And so shee began in this manner.
THE MARRIAGE OF CUPID AND PSYCHES
THE TWENTY-SECOND CHAPTER
The most pleasant and delectable tale of the marriage of Cupid and
Psyches.
There was sometimes a certaine King, inhabiting in the West parts, who
had to wife a noble Dame, by whom he had three daughters exceeding
fair: of whom the two elder were of such comly shape and beauty, as
they did excell and pass all other women living, whereby they were
thought worthily to deserve the praise and commendation of every
person, and deservedly to be preferred above the residue of the common
sort. Yet the singular passing beauty and maidenly majesty of the
youngest daughter did so farre surmount and excell then two, as no
earthly creature could by any meanes sufficiently expresse or set out
the same.
By reason wherof, after the fame of this excellent maiden was spread
about in every part of the City, the Citisens and strangers there
beeing inwardly pricked by the zealous affection to behold her famous
person, came daily by thousands, hundreths, and scores, to her fathers
palace, who was astonied with admiration of her incomparable beauty,
did no less worship and reverence her with crosses, signes, and tokens,
and other divine adorations, according to the custome of the old used
rites and ceremonies, than if she were the Lady Venus indeed, and
shortly after the fame was spread into the next cities and bordering
regions, that the goddess whom the deep seas had born and brought
forth, and the froth of the waves had nourished, to the intent to show
her high magnificencie and divine power on earth, to such as erst did
honour and worship her, was now conversant among mortall men, or else
that the earth and not the sea, by a new concourse and influence of the
celestiall planets, had budded and yeelded forth a new Venus, endued
with the floure of virginity.
So daily more and more encreased this opinion, and now is her flying
fame dispersed into the next Island, and well nigh unto every part and
province of the whole world. Wherupon innumerable strangers resorted
from farre Countries, adventuring themselves by long journies on land
and by great perils on water, to behold this glorious virgin. By
occasion wherof such a contempt grew towards the goddesse Venus, that
no person travelled unto the Towne Paphos, nor to the Isle Gyndos, nor
to Cythera to worship her. Her ornaments were throwne out, her temples
defaced, her pillowes and cushions torne, her ceremonies neglected, her
images and Statues uncrowned, and her bare altars unswept, and fowl
with the ashes of old burnt sacrifice. For why, every person honoured
and worshipped this maiden in stead of Venus, and in the morning at her
first comming abroad offered unto her oblations, provided banquets,
called her by the name of Venus, which was not Venus indeed, and in her
honour presented floures and garlands in most reverend fashion.
This sudden change and alteration of celestiall honour, did greatly
inflame and kindle the love of very Venus, who unable to temper her
selfe from indignation, shaking her head in raging sort, reasoned with
her selfe in this manner, Behold the originall parent of all these
elements, behold the Lady Venus renowned throughout all the world, with
whome a mortall maiden is joyned now partaker of honour: my name
registred in the city of heaven is prophaned and made vile by terrene
absurdities. If I shall suffer any mortall creature to present my
Majesty on earth, or that any shall beare about a false surmised shape
of her person, then in vaine did Paris the sheepheard (in whose
judgement and competence the great Jupiter had affiance) preferre me
above the residue of the goddesses, for the excellency of my beauty:
but she, whatever she be that hath usurped myne honour, shal shortly
repent her of her unlawful estate. And by and by she called her winged
sonne Cupid, rash enough and hardy, who by his evill manners contemning
all publique justice and law, armed with fire and arrowes, running up
and down in the nights from house to house, and corrupting the lawfull
marriages of every person, doth nothing but that which is evill, who
although that hee were of his owne proper nature sufficiently prone to
worke mischiefe, yet she egged him forward with words and brought him
to the city, and shewed him Psyches (for so the maid was called) and
having told the cause of her anger, not without great rage, I pray thee
(quoth she) my dear childe, by motherly bond of love, by the sweet
wounds of thy piercing darts, by the pleasant heate of thy fire,
revenge the injury which is done to thy mother by the false and
disobedient beauty of a mortall maiden, and I pray thee, that without
delay shee may fall in love with the most miserablest creature living,
the most poore, the most crooked, and the most vile, that there may bee
none found in all the world of like wretchednesse. When she had spoken
these words she embraced and kissed her sonne, and took her voyage
toward the sea.
When she came upon the sea she began to cal the gods and goddesses, who
were obedient at her voyce. For incontinent came the daughters of
Nereus, singing with tunes melodiously: Portunus with his bristled and
rough beard, Salita with her bosome full of fish, Palemon the driver of
the Dolphine, the Trumpetters of Tryton, leaping hither and thither,
and blowing with heavenly noyse: such was the company which followed
Venus, marching towards the ocean sea.
In the meane season Psyches with all her beauty received no fruit of
honor. She was wondred at of all, she was praised of all, but she
perceived that no King nor Prince, nor any one of the superiour sort
did repaire to wooe her. Every one marvelled at her divine beauty, as
it were some Image well painted and set out. Her other two sisters,
which were nothing so greatly exalted by the people, were royally
married to two Kings: but the virgin Psyches, sitting alone at home,
lamented her solitary life, and being disquieted both in mind and body,
although she pleased all the world, yet hated shee in her selfe her
owne beauty. Whereupon the miserable father of this unfortunate
daughter, suspecting that the gods and powers of heaven did envy her
estate, went to the town called Milet to receive the Oracle of Apollo,
where he made his prayers and offered sacrifice, and desired a husband
for his daughter: but Apollo though he were a Grecian, and of the
country of Ionia, because of the foundation of Milet, yet hee gave
answer in Latine verse, the sence whereof was this:—
Let Psyches corps be clad in mourning weed,
And set on rock of yonder hill aloft:
Her husband is no wight of humane seed,
But Serpent dire and fierce as might be thought.
Who flies with wings above in starry skies,
And doth subdue each thing with firie flight.
The gods themselves, and powers that seem so wise,
With mighty Jove, be subject to his might,
The rivers blacke, and deadly flouds of paine
And darkness eke, as thrall to him remaine.
The King, sometimes happy when he heard the prophesie of Apollo,
returned home sad and sorrowful, and declared to his wife the miserable
and unhappy fate of his daughter. Then they began to lament and weep,
and passed over many dayes in great sorrow. But now the time approached
of Psyches marriage, preparation was made, blacke torches were lighted,
the pleasant songs were turned into pittifull cries, the melody of
Hymeneus was ended with deadly howling, the maid that should be married
did wipe her eyes with her vaile. All the family and people of the city
weeped likewise, and with great lamentation was ordained a remisse time
for that day, but necessity compelled that Psyches should be brought to
her appointed place, according to the divine appointment.
And when the solemnity was ended, they went to bring the sorrowful
spowse, not to her marriage, but to her final end and burial. And while
the father and mother of Psyches did go forward weeping and crying unto
this enterprise, Psyches spake unto them in this sort: Why torment your
unhappy age with continuall dolour? Why trouble you your spirits, which
are more rather mine than yours? Why soyle ye your faces with teares,
which I ought to adore and worship? Why teare you my eyes in yours? why
pull you your hory haires? Why knocke ye your breasts for me? Now you
see the reward of my excellent beauty: now, now you perceive, but too
late, the plague of envy. When the people did honour me, and call me
new Venus, then yee should have wept, then you should have sorrowed as
though I had been dead: for now I see and perceive that I am come to
this misery by the only name of Venus, bring mee, and as fortune has
appointed, place me on the top of the rocke, I greatly desire to end my
marriage, I greatly covet to see my husband. Why doe I delay? why
should I refuse him that is appointed to destroy all the world.
Thus ended she her words, and thrust her selfe among the people that
followed. Then they brought her to the appointed rocke of the high
hill, and set [her] hereon, and so departed. The Torches and lights
were put out with the teares of the people, and every man gone home,
the miserable Parents well nigh consumed with sorrow, gave themselves
to everlasting darknes.
Thus poore Psyches being left alone, weeping and trembling on the toppe
of the rocke, was blowne by the gentle aire and of shrilling Zephyrus,
and carried from the hill with a meek winde, which retained her
garments up, and by little and little bought her downe into a deepe
valley, where she was laid in a bed of most sweet and fragrant flowers.
Thus faire Psyches being sweetly couched among the soft and tender
hearbs, as in a bed of sweet and fragrant floures, and having qualified
the thoughts and troubles of her restlesse minde, was now well reposed.
And when she had refreshed her selfe sufficiently with sleepe, she rose
with a more quiet and pacified minde, and fortuned to espy a pleasant
wood invironed with great and mighty trees. Shee espied likewise a
running river as cleare as crystall: in the midst of the wood well nigh
at the fall of the river was a princely Edifice, wrought and builded
not by the art or hand of man, but by the mighty power of God: and you
would judge at the first entry therin, that it were some pleasant and
worthy mansion for the powers of heaven. For the embowings above were
of Citron and Ivory, propped and undermined with pillars of gold, the
walls covered and seeled with silver, divers sorts of beasts were
graven and carved, that seemed to encounter with such as entered in.
All things were so curiously and finely wrought, that it seemed either
to be the worke of some Demy god, or of God himselfe. The pavement was
all of pretious stones, divided and cut one from another, whereon was
carved divers kindes of pictures, in such sort that blessed and thrice
blessed were they that might goe upon such a pavement: Every part and
angle of the house was so well adorned, that by reason of the pretious
stones and inestimable treasure there, it glittered and shone in such
sort, that the chambers, porches, and doores gave light as it had beene
the Sunne. Neither otherwise did the other treasure of the house
disagree unto so great a majesty, that verily it seemed in every point
an heavenly Palace, fabricate and built for Jupiter himselfe.
Then Psyches moved with delectation approched nigh and taking a bold
heart entred into the house, and beheld every thing there with great
affection, she saw storehouses wrought exceedingly fine, and
replenished with aboundance of riches. Finally, there could nothing be
devised which lacked there: but among such great store of treasure this
was most marvellous, that there was no closure, bolt, nor locke to
keepe the same. And when with great pleasure shee had viewed all these
things, she heard a voyce without any body, that sayd, Why doe you
marvell Madame at so great riches? behold, all that you see is at your
commandement, wherefore goe you into the chamber, and repose your selfe
upon the bed, and desire what bath you will have, and wee whose voyces
you heare bee your servants, and ready to minister unto you according
to your desire. In the meane season, royall meats and dainty dishes
shall be prepared for you.
Then Psyches perceived the felicity of divine providence, and according
to the advertisement of the incorporeall voyces she first reposed her
selfe upon the bed, and then refreshed her body in the baines. This
done, shee saw the table garnished with meats, and a chaire to sit
downe.
When Psyches was set downe, all sorts of divine meats and wines were
brought in, not by any body, but as it were with a winde, for she saw
no person before her, but only heard voyces on every side. After that
all the services were brought to the table, one came in and sung
invisibly, another played on the harpe, but she saw no man. The harmony
of the Instruments did so greatly shrill in her eares, that though
there were no manner of person, yet seemed she in the midst of a
multitude of people.
All these pleasures finished, when night aproched Psyches went to bed,
and when she was layd, that the sweet sleep came upon her, she greatly
feared her virginity, because shee was alone. Then came her unknowne
husband and lay with her: and after that hee had made a perfect
consummation of the marriage, he rose in the morning before day, and
departed. Soone after came her invisible servants, and presented to her
such things as were necessary for her defloration. And thus she passed
forth a great while, and as it happeneth, the novelty of the things by
continuall custome did encrease her pleasure, but especially the sound
of the instruments was a comfort to her being alone.
During this time that Psyches was in this place of pleasures, her
father and mother did nothing but weepe and lament, and her two sisters
hearing of her most miserable fortune, came with great dolour and
sorrow to comfort and speake with her parents.
The night following, Psyches husband spake unto her (for she might
feele his eyes, his hands, and his ears) and sayd, O my sweet Spowse
and dear wife, fortune doth menace unto thee imminent danger, wherof I
wish thee greatly to beware: for know that thy sisters, thinking that
thou art dead, bee greatly troubled, and are coming to the mountain by
thy steps. Whose lamentations if thou fortune to heare, beware that
thou doe in no wise make answer, or looke up towards them, for if thou
doe thou shalt purchase to mee great sorrow, and to thyself utter
destruction. Psyches hearing her Husband, was contented to doe all
things as hee had commanded.
After that hee was departed and the night passed away, Psyches lamented
and lamented all the day following, thinking that now shee was past all
hopes of comfort, in that shee was closed within the walls of a prison,
deprived of humane conversation, and commaunded not to aid her
sorrowful Sisters, no nor once to see them. Thus she passed all the day
in weeping, and went to bed at night, without any refection of meat or
baine.
Incontinently after came her husband, who when he had embraced her
sweetly, began to say, Is it thus that I find you perform your promise,
my sweet wife? What do I finde heere? Passe you all the day and the
night in weeping? And wil you not cease in your husbands armes? Goe
too, doe what ye will, purchase your owne destruction, and when you
find it so, then remember my words, and repent but too late. Then she
desired her husband more and more, assuring him that shee should die,
unlesse he would grant that she might see her sisters, wherby she might
speak with them and comfort them, wherat at length he was contented,
and moreover hee willed that shee should give them as much gold and
jewels as she would. But he gave her a further charge saying, Beware
that ye covet not (being mooved by the pernicious counsell of you
sisters) to see the shape of my person, lest by your curiosity you
deprive your selfe of so great and worthy estate. Psyches being glad
herewith, rendered unto him most entire thankes, and said, Sweet
husband, I had rather die than to bee separated from you, for whosoever
you bee, I love and retaine you within my heart, as if you were myne
owne spirit or Cupid himselfe: but I pray you grant this likewise, that
you would commaund your servant Zephyrus to bring my sisters downe into
the valley as he brought mee.
Wherewithall shee kissed him sweetly, and desired him gently to grant
her request, calling him her spowse, her sweetheart, her Joy and her
Solace. Wherby she enforced him to agree to her mind, and when morning
came he departed away.
After long search made, the sisters of Psyches came unto the hill where
she was set on the rocke, and cried with a loud voyce in such sort that
the stones answered againe. And when they called their sister by her
name, that their lamentable cries came unto her eares, shee came forth
and said, Behold, heere is shee for whom you weepe, I pray you torment
your selves no more, cease your weeping. And by and by she commaunded
Zephyrus by the appointment of her husband to bring them downe. Neither
did he delay, for with gentle blasts he retained them up and laid them
softly in the valley. I am not able to expresse the often embracing,
kissing and greeting which was between them three, all sorrows and
tears were then layd apart.
Come in (quoth Psyches) into our house, and refresh your afflicted
mindes with your sister.
After this she shewed them the storehouses of treasure, shee caused
them to hear the voyces which served her, the bain was ready, the meats
were brought in, and when they had filled themselves with divine
delecates, they conceived great envy within their hearts, and one of
them being curious, did demand what her husband was, of what estate,
and who was Lord of so pretious a house? But Psyches remembring the
promise which she had made to her husband, feigned that hee was a young
man, of comely stature, with a flaxen beard, and had great delight in
hunting the dales and hills by. And lest by her long talke she should
be found to trip or faile in her words, she filled their laps with
gold, silver, and Jewels, and commanded Zephyrus to carry them away.
When they were brought up to the mountain, they made their wayes
homeward to their owne houses, and murmured with envy that they bare
against Psyches, saying, behold cruell and contrary fortune, behold how
we, borne all of one Parent, have divers destinies: but especially we
that are the elder two bee married to strange husbands, made as
handmaidens, and as it were banished from our Countrey and friends.
Whereas our younger sister hath great abundance of treasure, and hath
gotten a god to her husband, although shee hath no skill how to use
such great plenty of riches. Saw you not sister what was in the house,
what great store of jewels, what glittering robes, what Gemmes, what
gold we trod on? That if shee hath a husband according as shee
affirmeth, there is none that liveth this day more happy in all the
world than she. And so it may come to passe, at length for the great
affection which hee may beare unto her that hee may make her a
goddesse, for by Hercules, such was her countenance, so she behaved her
self, that as a goddesse she had voices to serve her, and the windes
did obey her.
But I poore wretch have first married an husband elder than my father,
more bald than a Coot, more weake than a childe, and that locketh me up
all day in the house.
Then said the other sister, And in faith I am married to a husband that
hath the gout, twyfold, crooked, nor couragious in paying my debt, I am
faine to rub and mollifie his stony fingers with divers sorts of oyles,
and to wrap them in playsters and salves, so that I soyle my white and
dainty hands with the corruption of filthy clouts, not using my self
like a wife, but more like a servant. And you my sister seem likewise
to be in bondage and servitude, wherefore I cannot abide to see our
younger sister in such felicity; saw you not I pray you how proudly and
arrogantly she handled us even now? And how in vaunting her selfe she
uttered her presumptuous minde, how she cast a little gold into our
laps, and being weary of our company, commanded that we should be borne
and blown away?
Verily I live not, nor am a woman, but I will deprive her of all her
blisse. And if you my sister bee so far bent as I, let us consult
together, and not to utter our minde to any person, no not to our
parents, nor tell that ever we saw her. For it sufficeth that we have
seene her, whom it repenteth to have seene. Neither let us declare her
good fortune to our father, nor to any other, since as they seeme not
happy whose riches are unknowne: so shall she know that she hath
sisters no Abjects, but worthier than she.
But now let us goe home to our husbands and poore houses, and when we
are better instructed, let us return to suppresse her pride. So this
evill counsell pleased these two evil women, and they hid the treasure
which Psyches gave them, and tare their haire, renewing their false and
forged teares. When their father and mother beheld them weep and lament
still, they doubled their sorrowes and griefes, but full of yre and
forced with Envy, they tooke their voyage homeward, devising the
slaughter and destruction of their sister.
In the meane season the husband of Psyches did warne her againe in the
night with these words: Seest thou not (quoth he) what perill and
danger evill fortune doth threaten unto thee, whereof if thou take not
good heed it will shortly come upon thee. For the unfaithfull harlots
doe greatly endeavor to set their snares to catch thee, and their
purpose is to make and perswade thee to behold my face, which if thou
once fortune to see, as I have often told, thou shalt see no more.
Wherfore if these naughty hagges, armed with wicked minds, doe chance
to againe (as I think no otherwise but that they will) take heed that
thou talk not with them but simply suffer them to speake what they
will, howbeit if thou canst not refraine thy selfe, beware that thou
have no communication of thy husband, nor answer a word if they fortune
to question of me, so will we encrease our stocke, and this young and
tender childe, couched in this young and tender belly of thine, shall
be made an immortall god, otherwise a mortal creature. Then Psyches was
very glad that she should bring forth a divine babe, and very joyfull
in that she should be honored as a mother. She reckened and numbered
carefully the days and months that passed, and beeing never with child
before, did marvel greatly that in so short a time her belly should
swel so big. But those pestilent and wicked furies breathing out their
Serpentine poyson, took shipping to bring their enterprise to passe.
Then Psyches was warned again by her husband in this sort: Behold the
last day, the extream case, and the enemies of thy blood, hath armed
themselves against us, pitched their campe, set their host in array,
and are marching towards us, for now thy two sisters have drawn their
swords and are ready to slay thee. O with what force are we assailed on
this day! O sweet Psyches I pray thee to take pitty on thy selfe, of
me, and deliver thy husband and this infant within thy belly from so
great danger, and see not, neither heare these cursed women, which are
not worthy to be called thy sisters, for their great hatred and breach
of sisterly amity, for they wil come like Syrens to the mountains, and
yeeld out their pittious and lamentable cries. When Psyches had heard
these words she sighed sorrowfully and said, O deare husband this long
time have you had experience and triall of my faith, and doubt you not
that I will persever in the same, wherefore command your winde
Zephyrus, that hee may doe as hee hath done before, to the intent that
where you have charged me not to behold your venerable face, yet that I
may comfort myself with the sight of my sisters. I pray you by these
beautifull haires, by these round cheekes delicate and tender, by your
pleasant hot breast, whose shape and face I shall learn at length by
the childe in my belly, grant the fruit of my desire, refresh your
deare Spowse Psyches with joy, who is bound and linked unto you for
ever. I little esteeme to see your visage and figure, little doe I
regard the night and darknesse thereof, for you are my only light.
Her husband being as it were inchanted with these words and compelled
by violence of her often embracing, wiping away her teares with his
haire, did yeeld unto his wife. And when morning came, departed as hee
was accustomed to doe.
Now her sisters arrived on land, and never rested til they came to the
rock, without visiting their parents, and leapt down rashly from the
hill themselves. Then Zephyrus according to the divine commandment
brought them down, although it were against his wil, and laid them in
the vally without any harm: by and by they went into the palace to
their sister without leave, and when they had eftsoone embraced their
prey, and thanked her with flattering words for the treasure which she
gave them, they said, O deare sister Psyches, know you that you are now
no more a child, but a mother: O what great joy beare you unto us in
your belly? What a comfort will it be unto all the house? How happy
shall we be, that shall see this Infant nourished amongst so great
plenty of Treasure? That if he be like his parents, as it is necessary
he should, there is no doubt but a new cupid shall be borne. By this
kinde of measures they went about to winne Psyches by little and
little, but because they were wearie with travell, they sate them downe
in chaires, and after that they had washed their bodies in baines they
went into a parlour, where all kinde of meats were ready prepared.
Psyches commanded one to play with his harpe, it was done. Then
immediately others sung, others tuned their instruments, but no person
was seene, by whose sweet harmony and modulation the sisters of Psyches
were greatly delighted.
Howbeit the wickednesse of these cursed women was nothing suppressed by
the sweet noyse of these instruments, but they settled themselves to
work their treasons against Psyches, demanding who was her husband, and
of what Parentage. Then shee having forgotten by too much simplicity,
what shee had spoken before of her husband, invented a new answer, and
said that her husband was of a great province, a merchant, and a man of
middle age, having his beard intersparsed with grey haires. Which when
shee had spoken (because shee would have no further talke) she filled
their laps with Gold and Silver, and bid Zephyrus to bear them away.
In their returne homeward they murmured within themselves, saying, How
say you sister to so apparent a lye of Psyches? First she sayd that her
husband was a young man of flourishing yeares, and had a flaxen beard,
and now she sayth that he is halfe grey with age. What is he that in so
short a space can become so old? You shall finde it no otherwise my
sister, but that either this cursed queane hath invented a great lie,
or else that she never saw the shape of her husband. And if it be so
that she never saw him, then verily she is married to some god, and
hath a young god in her belly. But if it be a divine babe, and fortune
to come to the eares of my mother (as God forbid it should) then may I
go and hang my selfe: wherfore let us go to our parents, and with
forged lies let us colour the matter.
After they were thus inflamed, and had visited their Parents, they
returned againe to the mountaine, and by the aid of the winde Zephyrus
were carried down into the valley, and after they had streined their
eye lids, to enforce themselves to weepe, they called unto Psyches in
this sort, Thou (ignorant of so great evill) thinkest thy selfe sure
and happy, and sittest at home nothing regarding thy peril, whereas wee
goe about thy affaires and are carefull lest any harme should happen
unto you: for we are credibly informed, neither can we but utter it
unto you, that there is a great serpent full of deadly poyson, with a
ravenous gaping throat, that lieth with thee every night. Remember the
Oracle of Apollo, who pronounced that thou shouldest be married to a
dire and fierce Serpent, and many of the Inhabitants hereby, and such
as hunt about in the countrey, affirme that they saw him yesternight
returning from pasture and swimming over the River, whereby they doe
undoubtedly say, that hee will not pamper thee long with delicate
meats, but when the time of delivery shall approach he will devoure
both thee and thy child: wherefore advise thy selfe whether thou wilt
agree unto us that are carefull of thy safety, and so avoid the perill
of death, bee contented to live with thy sisters, or whether thou
remaine with the Serpent and in the end be swallowed into the gulfe of
his body. And if it be so that thy solitary life, thy conversation with
voices, this servile and dangerous pleasure, and the love of the
Serpent doe more delight thee, say not but that we have played the
parts of naturall sisters in warning thee.
Then the poore and simple miser Psyches was mooved with the feare of so
dreadful words, and being amazed in her mind, did cleane forget the
admonitions of her husband, and her owne promises made unto him, and
throwing her selfe headlong into extreame misery, with a wanne and
sallow countenance, scantly uttering a third word, at length gan say in
this sort: O my most deare sisters, I heartily thanke you for your
great kindnesse toward me, and I am now verily perswaded that they
which have informed you hereof hath informed you of nothing but truth,
for I never saw the shape of my husband, neither know I from whence he
came, only I heare his voice in the night, insomuch that I have an
uncertaine husband, and one that loveth not the light of the day: which
causeth me to suspect that he is a beast, as you affirme. Moreover, I
doe greatly feare to see him, for he doth menace and threaten great
evill unto mee, if I should goe about to spy and behold his shape
wherefore my loving sisters if you have any wholeome remedy for your
sister in danger, give it now presently. Then they opened the gates of
their subtill mindes, and did put away all privy guile, and egged her
forward in her fearefull thoughts, perswading her to doe as they would
have her whereupon one of them began and sayd, Because that wee little
esteeme any perill or danger, to save your life we intend to shew you
the best way and meane as we may possibly do. Take a sharpe razor and
put it under the pillow of your bed; and see that you have ready a
privy burning lampe with oyle, hid under some part of the hanging of
the chamber, and finely dissembling the matter when according to his
custome he commeth to bed and sleepeth soundly, arise you secretly, and
with your bare feet goe and take the lampe, with the Razor in your
right hand and with valiant force cut off the head of the poysonous
serpent, wherein we will aid and assist you: and when by the death of
him you shall be made safe, we wil marry you to some comely man.
After they had thus inflamed the heart of their sister fearing lest
some danger might happen unto them by reason of their evill counsell,
they were carried by the wind Zephyrus to the top of the mountaine, and
so they ran away and tooke shipping.
When Psyches was left alone (saving that she seemed not to be alone,
being stirred by so many furies) she was in a tossing minde like the
waves of the sea, and although her wil was obstinate, and resisted to
put in execution the counsell of her Sisters, yet she was in doubtfull
and divers opinions touching her calamity. Sometime she would, sometime
she would not, sometime she is bold, sometime she feareth, sometime
shee mistrusteth, somtime she is mooved, somtime she hateth the beast,
somtime she loveth her husband: but at length night came, when as she
prepared for her wicked intent.
Soon after her husband came, and when he had kissed and embraced her he
fell asleep. Then Psyches (somwhat feeble in body and mind, yet mooved
by cruelty of fate) received boldnes and brought forth the lampe, and
tooke the razor, so by her audacity she changed her mind: but when she
took the lamp and came to the bed side, she saw the most meeke and
sweetest beast of all beasts, even faire Cupid couched fairly, at whose
sight the very lampe encreased his light for joy, and the razor turned
his edge.
But when Psyches saw so glorious a body shee greatly feared, and amazed
in mind, with a pale countenance all trembling fel on her knees and
thought to hide the razor, yea verily in her owne heart, which
doubtlesse she had done, had it not through feare of so great an
enterprise fallen out of her hand. And when she saw and beheld the
beauty of the divine visage shee was well recreated in her mind, she
saw his haires of gold, that yeelded out a sweet savor, his neck more
white than milk, his purple cheeks, his haire hanging comely behinde
and before, the brightnesse whereof did darken the light of the lamp,
his tender plume feathers, dispersed upon his sholders like shining
flours, and trembling hither and thither, and his other parts of his
body so smooth and so soft, that it did not repent Venus to beare such
a childe. At the beds feet lay his bow, quiver, and arrowes, that be
the weapons of so great a god: which when Psyches did curiously behold,
she marvelling at her husbands weapons, took one of the arrows out of
the quiver, and pricked her selfe withall, wherwith she was so
grievously wounded that the blood followed, and thereby of her owne
accord shee added love upon love; then more broyling in the love of
Cupid shee embraced him and kissed him and kissed him a thousand times,
fearing the measure of his sleepe. But alas while shee was in this
great joy, whether it were for envy for desire to touch this amiable
body likewise, there fell out a droppe of burning oyle from the lampe
upon the right shoulder of the god. O rash and bold lampe, the vile
ministery of love, how darest thou bee so bold as to burne the god of
all fire? When as he invented thee, to the intent that all lovers might
with more joy passe the nights in pleasure.
The god beeing burned in this sort, and perceiving that promise and
faith was broken, hee fled away without utterance of any word, from the
eyes and hands of his most unhappy wife. But Psyches fortuned to catch
him as hee was rising by the right thigh, and held him fast as hee flew
above in the aire, until such time as constrained by wearinesse shee
let goe and fell downe upon the ground. But Cupid followed her downe,
and lighted upon the top of a Cypresse tree, and angerly spake unto her
in this manner: O simple Psyches, consider with thy selfe how I, little
regarding the commandement of my mother (who willed mee that thou
shouldst bee married to a man of base and miserable condition) did come
my selfe from heaven to love thee, and wounded myne owne body with my
proper weapons, to have thee to my Spowse: And did I seeme a beast unto
thee, that thou shouldst go about to cut off my head with a razor, who
loved thee so well? Did not I alwayes give thee a charge? Did not I
gently will thee to beware? But those cursed aides and Counsellors of
thine shall be worthily rewarded for their pains. As for thee thou
shalt be sufficiently punished by my absence. When hee had spoken these
words he tooke his flight into the aire. Then Psyches fell flat on the
ground, and as long as she could see her husband she cast her eyes
after him into the aire, weeping and lamenting pitteously: but when hee
was gone out of her sight shee threw her selfe into the next running
river, for the great anguish and dolour that shee was in for the lack
of her husband, howbeit the water would not suffer her to be drowned,
but tooke pity upon her, in the honour of Cupid which accustomed to
broyle and burne the river, and threw her upon the bank amongst the
herbs.
Then Pan the rusticall god sitting on the river side, embracing and
[instructing] the goddesse Canna to tune her songs and pipes, by whom
were feeding the young and tender Goats, after that he perceived
Psyches in sorrowful case, not ignorant (I know not by what meanes) of
her miserable estate, endeavored to pacific her in this sort: O faire
maid, I am a rusticke and rude heardsman, howbeit by reason of my old
age expert in many things, for as farre as I can learnt by conjecture
(which according as wise men doe terme is called divination) I perceive
by your uncertaine gate, your pale hew, your sobbing sighes, and your
watery eyes, that you are greatly in love. Wherefore hearken to me, and
goe not about to slay your selfe, nor weepe not at all, but rather
adore and worship the great god Cupid, and winne him unto you by your
gentle promise of service.
When the god of Shepherds had spoken these words, she gave no answer,
but made reverence to him as to a god, and so departed.
After that Psyches had gone a little way, she fortuned unawares to come
to a city where the husband of one of her Sisters did dwell. Which when
Psyches did understand, shee caused that her sister had knowledge of
her comming, and so they met together, and after great embracing and
salutation, the sister of Psyches demaunded the cause of her travell
thither. Marry (quoth she) doe you not remember the counsell you gave
me, whereby you would that I should kill the beast which under colour
of my husband did lie with mee every night? You shall understand, that
as soone as I brought forth the lampe to see and behold his shape, I
perceived that he was the sonne of Venus, even Cupid himselfe that lay
with mee. Then I being stricken with great pleasure, and desirous to
embrace him, could not thoroughly asswage my delight, but alas by evill
ill chance the oyle of the lampe fortuned to fall on his shoulder which
caused him to awake, and seeing me armed with fire and weapons, gan
say, How darest thou be so bold to doe so great a mischiefe? Depart
from me and take such things as thou didst bring: for I will have thy
sister (and named you) to my wife, and she shall be placed in thy
felicity, and by and by hee commaunded Zephyrus to carry me away from
the bounds of his house.
Psyches had scantly finished her tale but her sister pierced with the
pricke of carnall desire and wicked envy ran home, and feigning to her
husband that she had heard word of the death of her parents tooke
shipping and came to the mountaine. And although there blew a contrary
winde, yet being brought in a vaine hope shee cried O Cupid take me a
more worthy wife, and thou Zephyrus beare downe thy mistresse, and so
she cast her selfe headlong from the mountaine: but shee fell not into
the valley neither alive nor dead, for all the members and parts of her
body were torne amongst the rockes, wherby she was made prey unto the
birds and wild beasts, as she worthily deserved.
Neither was the vengeance of the other delayed, for Psyches travelling
in that country, fortuned to come to another city where her other
sister did dwel; to whom when shee had declared all such things as she
told to her other sister shee ran likewise unto the rock and was slaine
in like sort. Then Psyches travelled about in the countrey to seeke her
husband Cupid, but he was gotten into his mothers chamber and there
bewailed the sorrowful wound which he caught by the oyle of a burning
lamp.
Then the white bird the Gull, which swims on the waves of the water,
flew toward the Ocean sea, where he found Venus washing and bathing her
selfe: to whom she declared that her son was burned and in danger of
death, and moreover that it was a common brute in the mouth of every
person (who spake evill of all the family of Venus) that her son doth
nothing but haunt harlots in the mountain, and she her self
lasciviously use to ryot in the sea: wherby they say that they are now
become no more gratious, pleasant nor gentle, but incivile, monstrous
and horrible. Moreover, that marriages are not for any amity, or for
love of procreation, but full of envy, discord, and debate. This the
curious Gul did clatter in the ears of Venus, reprehending her son. But
Venus began to cry and sayd, What hath my sonne gotten any Love? I pray
thee gentle bird that doest serve me so faithfully, tell me what she
is, and what is her name that hath troubled my son in such sort?
whether shee be any of the Nymphs, of the number of the goddesses, of
the company of the Muses, or of the mistery of the Graces? To whom the
bird answered, Madam I know not what shee is, but this I know that she
is called Psyches. Then Venus with indignation cried out, What is it
she? the usurper of my beauty, the Vicar of my name? What did he think
that I was a bawd, by whose shew he fell acquainted with the maid? And
immediately she departed and went to her chamber, where she found her
son wounded as it was told unto her, whom when she beheld she cries out
in this sort.
Is this an honest thing, is this honourable to thy parents? is this
reason, that thou hast violated and broken the commandement of thy
mother and soveraign mistresse: and whereas thou shouldst have vexed my
enemy with loathsom love, thou hast done otherwise?
For being of tender and unripe yeares, thou hast with too licentious
appetite embraced my most mortall Foe, to whome I shall bee made a
mother, and she a Daughter.
Thou presumest and thinkest, thou trifling boy, thou Varlet, and
without all reverence, that thou art most worthy and excellent, and
that I am not able by reason of myne age to have another son, which if
I should have, thou shouldst well understand that I would beare a more
worthier than thou. But to worke thee a greater despight, I do
determine to adopt one of my servants, and to give him these wings,
this fire, this bow, and these Arrowes, and all other furniture which I
gave to thee, not to this purpose, neither is any thing given thee of
thy father for this intent: but first thou hast been evill brought up
and instructed in thy youth thou hast thy hands ready and sharpe. Thou
hast often offended thy antients, and especially me that am thy mother,
thou hast pierced mee with thy darts thou contemnest me as a widow,
neither dost thou regard thy valiant and invincible father, and to
anger me more, thou art amorous of harlots and wenches: hot I will
cause that thou shalt shortly repent thee, and that this marriage shal
be dearely bought. To what a point am I now driven? What shall I do?
Whither shall I goe? How shall I represse this beast? Shall I aske ayd
of myne enemy Sobriety, whom I have often offended to engender thee? Or
shall I seeke for counsel of every poore rusticall woman? No, no, yet
had I rather dye, howbeit I will not cease my vengeance, to her must I
have recourse for helpe, and to none other (I meane to Sobriety), who
may correct thee sharpely, take away thy quiver, deprive thee of thy
arrowes, unbend thy bow, quench thy fire, and which is more subdue thy
body with punishment: and when that I have rased and cut off this thy
haire, which I have dressed with myne owne hands, and made to glitter
like gold, and when I have clipped thy wings, which I my selfe have
caused to burgen, then shall I thinke to have revenged my selfe
sufficiently upon thee for the injury which thou hast done. When shee
had spoken these words shee departed in a great rage out of her
chamber.
Immediatelie as she was going away came Juno and Ceres, demaunding the
cause of her anger. Then Venus answered, Verily you are come to comfort
my sorrow, but I pray you with all diligence to seeke out one whose
name is Psyches, who is a vagabond, and runneth about the Countries,
and (as I thinke) you are not ignorant of the brute of my son Cupid,
and of his demeanour, which I am ashamed to declare. Then they
understanding the whole matter, endeavoured to mitigate the ire of
Venus in this sort: What is the cause Madam, or how hath your son so
offended, that you shold so greatly accuse his love, and blame him by
reason that he is amorous? and why should you seeke the death of her,
whom he doth fancie? We most humbly intreat you to pardon his fault if
he have accorded to the mind of any maiden: what do you not know that
he is a young man? Or have you forgotten of what yeares he is? Doth he
seeme alwayes unto you to be a childe? You are his mother, and a kind
woman, will you continually search out his dalliance? Will you blame
his luxury? Will you bridle his love? and will you reprehend your owne
art and delights in him? What God or man is hee, that can endure that
you should sowe or disperse your seed of love in every place, and to
make restraint thereof within your owne doores? certes you will be the
cause of the suppression of the publike paces of young Dames. In this
sort this goddesse endeavoured to pacifie her mind, and to excuse Cupid
with al their power (although he were absent) for feare of his darts
and shafts of love. But Venus would in no wise asswage her heat, but
(thinking that they did rather trifle and taunt at her injuries) she
departed from them, and tooke her voiage towards the sea in all haste.
In the meane season Psyches hurled her selfe hither and thither, to
seeke her husband, the rather because she thought that if he would not
be appeased with the sweet flattery of his wife, yet he would take
mercy on her at her servile and continuall prayers. And (espying a
Church on the top of a high hill) she said, What can I tell whether my
husband and master be there or no? wherefore she went thitherward, and
with great paine and travell, moved by hope, after that she climbed to
the top of the mountaine, she came to the temple, and went in, wheras
behold she espied sheffes of corn lying on a heap, blades withered with
garlands, and reeds of barly, moreover she saw hooks, sithes, sickles,
and other instruments, to reape, but every thing lay out of order, and
as it were cast in by the hands of laborers which when Psyches saw she
gathered up and put everything in order, thinking that she would not
despise or contemne the temples of any of the Gods, but rather get the
favour and benevolence of them all: by and by Ceres came in, and
beholding her busie and curious in her chapell, cried out a far off,
and said, O Psyches needfull of mercy, Venus searcheth for thee in
every place to revenge her selfe and to punish thee grievously, but
thou hast more mind to be heere, and carest for nothing lesse, then for
thy safety. Then Psyches fell on her knees before her, watring her feet
with her teares, wiping the ground with her haire, and with great
weeping and lamentation desired pardon, saying, O great and holy
Goddesse, I pray thee by thy plenteous and liberall right hand, by the
joyfull ceremonies of thy harvest, by the secrets of thy Sacrifice, by
the flying chariots of thy dragons, by the tillage of the ground of
Sicilie, which thou hast invented, by the marriage of Proserpin, by the
diligent inquisition of thy daughter, and by the other secrets which
are within the temple of Eleusis in the land of Athens, take pitty on
me thy servant Psyches, and let me hide my selfe a few dayes amongst
these sheffes of corne, untill the ire of so great a Goddesse be past,
or until that I be refreshed of my great labour and travell. Then
answered Ceres, Verely Psyches, I am greatly moved by thy prayers and
teares, and desire with all my heart to aide thee, but if I should
suffer thee to be hidden here, I should increase the displeasure of my
Cosin, with whom I have made a treatie of peace, and an ancient promise
of amity: wherefore I advise thee to depart hence and take it not in
evil part in that I will not suffer thee to abide and remaine here
within my temple. Then Psyches driven away contrary to her hope, was
double afflicted with sorrow and so she returned back againe. And
behold she perceived a far off in a vally a Temple standing within a
Forest, faire and curiously wrought, and minding to over-passe no place
whither better hope did direct her, and to the intent she would desire
pardon of every God, she approached nigh unto the sacred doore, whereas
she saw pretious riches and vestiments ingraven with letters of gold,
hanging upon branches of trees, and the posts of the temple testifying
the name of the goddesse Juno, to whom they were dedicate, then she
kneeled downe upon her knees, and imbraced the Alter with her hands,
and wiping her teares, gan pray in this sort: O deere spouse and sister
of the great God Jupiter which art adored and worshipped amongst the
great temples of Samos, called upon by women with child, worshipped at
high Carthage, because thou wast brought from heaven by the lyon, the
rivers of the floud Inachus do celebrate thee: and know that thou art
the wife of the great god, and the goddesse of goddesses; all the east
part of the world have thee in veneration, all the world calleth thee
Lucina: I pray thee to be my advocate in my tribulations, deliver me
from the great danger which pursueth me, and save me that am weary with
so long labours and sorrow, for I know that it is thou that succorest
and helpest such women as are with child and in danger. Then Juno
hearing the prayers of Psyches, appeared unto her in all her royalty,
saying, Certes Psyches I would gladly help thee, but I am ashamed to do
any thing contrary to the will of my daughter in law Venus, whom
alwaies I have loved as mine owne child, moreover I shall incurre the
danger of the law, intituled, De servo corrupto, whereby am forbidden
to retaine any servant fugitive, against the will of his Master. Then
Psyches cast off likewise by Juno, as without all hope of the recovery
of her husband, reasoned with her selfe in this sort: Now what comfort
or remedy is left to my afflictions, when as my prayers will nothing
availe with the goddesses? what shall I do? whither shall I go? In what
cave or darknesse shall I hide my selfe, to avoid the furor of Venus?
Why do I not take a good heart, and offer my selfe with humilitie unto
her, whose anger I have wrought? What do I know whether he (whom I
seeke for) be in his mothers house or no? Thus being in doubt, poore
Psyches prepared her selfe to her owne danger, and devised how she
might make her orison and prayer unto Venus. After that Venus was weary
with searching by Sea and Land for Psyches, shee returned toward
heaven, and commanded that one should prepare her Chariot, which her
husband Vulcanus gave unto her by reason of marriage, so finely wrought
that neither gold nor silver could be compared to the brightnesse
therof. Four white pigeons guided the chariot with great diligence, and
when Venus was entred in a number of sparrowes flew chirping about,
making signe of joy, and all other kind of birds sang sweetly,
foreshewing the comming of the great goddesse: the clouds gave place,
the heavens opened, and received her joyfully, the birds that followed
nothing feared the Eagle, Hawkes, or other ravenous foules of the aire.
Incontinently she went unto the royall Pallace of God Jupiter, and with
a proud and bold petition demanded the service of Mercury, in certaine
of her affaires, whereunto Jupiter consented: then with much joy shee
descended from Heaven with Mercury, and gave him an earnest charge to
put in execution her words, saying: O my Brother, borne in Arcadia,
thou knowest well, that I (who am thy sister) did never enterprise to
doe any thing without thy presence, thou knowest also how long I have
sought for a girle and cannot finde her, wherefore there resteth
nothing else save that thou with thy trumpet doe pronounce the reward
to such as take her: see thou put in execution my commandment, and
declare that whatsoever he be that retaineth her wittingly, against my
will shall not defend himselfe by any meane or excusation: which when
she had spoken, she delivered unto him a libell, wherein was contained
the name of Psyches, and the residue of his publication, which done,
she departed away to her lodging. By and by, Mercurius (not delaying
the matter) proclaimed throughout all the world, that whatsoever hee
were that could tell any tydings of a Kings fugitive Daughter, the
servant of Venus, named Psyches, should bring word to Mercury, and for
reward of his paines, he should receive seaven sweet kisses of Venus.
After that Mercury had pronounced these things, every man was enflamed
with desire to search out Psyches.
This proclamation was the cause that put all doubt from Psyches, who
was scantly come in the sight of the house of Venus, but one of her
servants called Custome came out, who espying Psyches, cried with a
loud voyce, saying: O wicked harlot as thou art, now at length thou
shalt know that thou hast a mistresse above thee. What, dost thou make
thy selfe ignorant, as though thou didst not understand what travell
wee have taken in searching for thee? I am glad that thou art come into
my hands, thou art now in the golfe of hell, and shalt abide the paine
and punishment of thy great contumacy, and therewithall she tooke her
by the haire, and brought her in, before the presence of the goddesse
Venus. When Venus spied her, shee began to laugh, and as angry persons
accustome to doe, she shaked her head, and scratched her right eare
saying, O goddesse, goddesse, you are now come at length to visit your
husband that is in danger of death, by your meanes: bee you assured, I
will handle you like a daughter: where be my maidens, Sorrow and
Sadnesse? To whom (when they came) she delivered Psyches to be cruelly
tormented; then they fulfilled the commandement of their Mistresse, and
after they had piteously scourged her with rods and whips, they
presented her againe before Venus; then she began to laugh againe,
saying: Behold she thinketh (that by reason of her great belly, which
she hath gotten by playing the whore) to move me to pitty, and to make
me a grandmother to her childe. Am not I happy, that in the flourishing
time of al mine age, shall be called a grandmother, and the sonne of a
vile harlot shall bee accounted the nephew of Venus: howbeit I am a
foole to tearm him by the name of my son, since as the marriage was
made betweene unequall persons, in the field without witnesses, and not
by the consent of parents, wherefore the marriage is illegitimate, and
the childe (that shall be borne) a bastard; if we fortune to suffer
thee to live so long till thou be delivered. When Venus had spoken
these words she leaped upon the face of poore Psyches, and (tearing her
apparell) tooke her by the haire, and dashed her head upon the ground.
Then she tooke a great quantity of wheat, of barly, poppy seede,
peason, lintles, and beanes, and mingled them altogether on a heape
saying: Thou evil favoured girle, thou seemest unable to get the grace
of thy lover, by no other meanes, but only by diligent and painefull
service, wherefore I will prove what thou canst doe: see that thou
separate all these graines one from another, disposing them orderly in
their quantity, and let it be done before night. When she had appointed
this taske unto Psyches, she departed to a great banket that was
prepared that day. But Psyches went not about to dissever the graine,
(as being a thing impossible to be brought to passe by reason it lay so
confusedly scattered) but being astonyed at the cruell commandement of
Venus, sate still and said nothing. Then the little pismire the emote,
taking pitty of her great difficulty and labour, cursing the
cruellnesse of the daughter of Jupiter, and of so evill a mother, ran
about, hither and thither, and called to all her friends, Yee quick
sons of the ground, the mother of all things, take mercy on this poore
maid, espouse to Cupid, who is in great danger of her person, I pray
you helpe her with all diligence. Incontinently one came after another,
dissevering and dividing the graine, and after that they had put each
kinde of corne in order, they ranne away againe in all haste. When
night came, Venus returned home from the banket wel tippled with wine,
smelling of balme, and crowned with garlands of roses, who when shee
had espied what Psyches had done, gan say, This is not the labour of
thy hands, but rather of his that is amorous of thee: then she gave her
a morsel of brown bread, and went to sleep. In the mean season, Cupid
was closed fast in the surest chamber of the house, partly because he
should not hurt himself with wanton dalliance, and partly because he
should not speake with his love: so these two lovers were divided one
from another. When night was passed Venus called Psyches, and said,
Seest thou yonder Forest that extendeth out in length with the river?
there be great sheepe shining like gold, and kept by no manner of
person. I command thee that thou go thither and bring me home some of
the wooll of their fleeces. Psyches arose willingly not to do her
commandement, but to throw her selfe headlong into water to end her
sorrows. Then a green reed inspired by divine inspiration, with a
gratious tune and melody gan say, O Psyches I pray thee not to trouble
or pollute my water by the death of thee, and yet beware that thou goe
not towards the terrible sheepe of this coast, untill such time as the
heat of the sunne be past, for when the sunne is in his force, then
seeme they most dreadfull and furious, with their sharpe hornes, their
stony foreheads and their gaping throats, wherewith they arme
themselves to the destruction of mankinde. But untill they have
refreshed themselves in the river, thou must hide thy selfe here by me,
under this great plaine tree, and as soone as their great fury is past,
thou maist goe among the thickets and bushes under the wood side and
gather the lockes their golden Fleeces, which thou shalt finde hanging
upon the briers. Then spake the gentle and benigne reed, shewing a mean
to Psyches to save her life, which she bore well in memory, and with
all diligence went and gathered up such lockes as shee found, and put
them in her apron, and carried them home to Venus. Howbeit the danger
of this second labour did not please her, nor give her sufficient
witnesse of the good service of Psyches, but with a sower resemblance
of laughter, did say: Of a certaine I know that this is not thy fact,
but I will prove if that thou bee of so stout, so good a courage, and
singular prudency as thou seemest to bee. Then Venus spake unto Psyches
againe saying: Seest thou the toppe of yonder great Hill, from whence
there runneth downe waters of blacke and deadly colour, which
nourisheth the floods of Stix, Cocytus? I charge thee to goe thither,
and bring me a vessell of that water: wherewithall she gave her a
bottle of Christall, menacing and threatening her rigorously. Then poor
Psyches went in all haste to the top of the mountaine, rather to end
her life, then to fetch any water, and when she was come up to the
ridge of the hill, she perceived that it was impossible to bring it to
passe: for she saw a great rocke gushing out most horrible fountaines
of waters, which ran downe and fell by many stops and passages into the
valley beneath: on each side shee did see great Dragons, which were
stretching out their long and bloody Neckes, that did never sleepe, but
appointed to keepe the river there: the waters seemed to themselves
likewise saying, Away; away, what wilt thou doe? flie, flie, or else
thou wilt be slaine. Then Psyches (seeing the impossibility of this
affaire) stood still as though she were transformed into a stone and
although she was present in body, yet was she absent in spirit and
sense, by reason of the great perill which she saw, insomuch that she
could not comfort her self with weeping, such was the present danger
that she was in. But the royall bird of great Jupiter, the Eagle
remembring his old service which he had done, when as by the pricke of
Cupid he brought up the boy Ganimedes, to the heavens, to be made
butler of Jupiter, and minding to shew the like service in the person
of the wife of Cupid, came from the high-house of the Skies, and said
unto Psyches, O simple woman without all experience, doest thou thinke
to get or dip up any drop of this dreadfull water? No, no, assure thy
selfe thou art never able to come nigh it, for the Gods themselves do
greatly feare at the sight thereof. What, have you not heard, that it
is a custome among men to sweare by the puissance of the Gods, and the
Gods do sweare by the majesty of the river Stix? but give me thy
bottle, and sodainly he tooke it, and filled it with the water of the
river, and taking his flight through those cruell and horrible dragons,
brought it unto Psyches: who being very joyfull thereof, presented it
to Venus, who would not yet be appeased, but menacing more and more
said, What, thou seemest unto me a very witch and enchauntresse, that
bringest these things to passe, howbeit thou shalt do nothing more.
Take this box and to Hell to Proserpina, and desire her to send me a
little of her beauty, as much as will serve me the space of one day,
and say that such as I had is consumed away since my sonne fell sicke,
but returne againe quickly, for I must dresse my selfe therewithall,
and goe to the Theatre of the Gods: then poore Psyches perceived the
end of all fortune, thinking verely that she should never returne, and
not without cause, when as she was compelled to go to the gulfe and
furies of hell. Wherefore without any further delay, she went up to an
high tower to throw her selfe downe headlong (thinking that it was the
next and readiest way to hell) but the tower (as inspired) spake unto
her saying, O poore miser, why goest thou about to slay thy selfe? Why
dost thou rashly yeeld unto thy last perill and danger? know thou that
if thy spirit be once separated from thy body, thou shalt surely go to
hell, but never to returne againe, wherefore harken to me; Lacedemon a
Citie in Greece is not farre hence: go thou thither and enquire for the
hill Tenarus, whereas thou shalt find a hold leading to hell, even to
the Pallace of Pluto, but take heede thou go not with emptie hands to
that place of darknesse: but Carrie two sops sodden in the flour of
barley and Honney in thy hands, and two halfepence in thy mouth. And
when thou hast passed a good part of that way, thou shalt see a lame
Asse carrying of wood, and a lame fellow driving him, who will desire
thee to give him up the sticks that fall downe, but passe thou on and
do nothing; by and by thou shalt come unto a river of hell, whereas
Charon is ferriman, who will first have his fare paied him, before he
will carry the soules over the river in his boat, whereby you may see
that avarice raigneth amongst the dead, neither Charon nor Pluto will
do any thing for nought: for if it be a poore man that would passe over
and lacketh money, he shal be compelled to die in his journey before
they will shew him any reliefe, wherefore deliver to carraine Charon
one of the halfpence (which thou bearest for thy passage) and let him
receive it out of thy mouth. And it shall come to passe as thou sittest
in the boat thou shalt see an old man swimming on the top of the river,
holding up his deadly hands, and desiring thee to receive him into the
barke, but have no regard to his piteous cry; when thou art passed over
the floud, thou shalt espie old women spinning, who will desire thee to
helpe them, but beware thou do not consent unto them in any case, for
these and like baits and traps will Venus set to make thee let fall one
of thy sops, and thinke not that the keeping of thy sops is a light
matter, for if thou leese one of them thou shalt be assured never to
returne againe to this world. Then shalt thou see a great and
marvailous dogge, with three heads, barking continually at the soules
of such as enter in, but he can do them no other harme, he lieth day
and night before the gate of Proserpina, and keepeth the house of Pluto
with great diligence, to whom if thou cast one of thy sops, thou maist
have accesse to Proserpina without all danger: shee will make thee good
cheere, and entertaine thee with delicate meate and drinke, but sit
thou upon the ground, and desire browne bread, and then declare thy
message unto her, and when thou hast received such beauty as she
giveth, in thy returne appease the rage of the dogge with thy other
sop, and give thy other halfe penny to covetous Charon, and come the
same way againe into the world as thou wentest: but above all things
have a regard that thou looke not in the boxe, neither be not too
curious about the treasure of the divine beauty. In this manner the
tower spake unto Psyches, and advertised her what she should do: and
immediately she tooke two halfe pence, two sops, and all things
necessary, and went to the mountaine Tenarus to go towards hell. After
that Psyches had passed by the lame Asse, paid her halfe pennie for
passage, neglected the old man in the river, denyed to helpe the woman
spinning, and filled the ravenous month of the dogge with a sop, shee
came to the chamber of Proserpina. There Psyches would not sit in any
royall seate, nor eate any delicate meates, but kneeled at the feete of
Proserpina, onely contented with course bread, declared her message,
and after she had received a mysticall secret in a boxe, she departed,
and stopped the mouth of the dogge with the other sop, and paied the
boatman the other halfe penny. When Psyches was returned from hell, to
the light of the world, shee was ravished with great desire, saying, Am
not I a foole, that knowing that I carrie here the divine beauty, will
not take a little thereof to garnish my face, to please my love
withall? And by and by shee opened the boxe where she could perceive no
beauty nor any thing else, save onely an infernall and deadly sleepe,
which immediatly invaded all her members as soone as the boxe was
uncovered, in such sort that she fell downe upon the ground, and lay
there as a sleeping corps.
But Cupid being now healed of his wound and Maladie, not able to endure
the absence of Psyches, got him secretly out at a window of the chamber
where hee was enclosed, and (receiving his wings,) tooke his flight
towards his loving wife, whom when he had found, hee wiped away the
sleepe from her face, and put it againe into the boxe, and awaked her
with the tip of one of his arrows, saying: O wretched Caitife, behold
thou wert well-nigh perished againe, with the overmuch curiositie:
well, goe thou, and do thy message to my Mother, and in the meane
season, I will provide for all things accordingly: wherewithall he
tooke his flight into the aire, and Psyches brought her present to
Venus.
Cupid being more and more in love with Psyches, and fearing the
displeasure of his Mother, did pearce into the heavens, and arrived
before Jupiter to declare his cause: then Jupiter after that hee had
eftsoone embraced him, gan say in this manner: O my well beloved sonne,
although thou haste not given due reverence and honour unto me as thou
oughtest to doe, but haste rather spoiled and wounded this my brest
(whereby the laws and order of the Elements and Planets be disposed)
with continuall assaults, of Terren luxury and against all laws, and
the discipline Julia, and the utility of the publike weale, in
transforming my divine beauty into serpents, fire, savage beasts,
birds, and into Bulles: howbeit remembring my modesty, and that I have
nourished thee with mine owne proper hands, I will doe and accomplish
all thy desire, so that thou canst beware of spitefull and envious
persons. And if there be any excellent Maiden of comely beauty in the
world, remember yet the benefit which I shall shew unto thee by
recompence of her love towards me againe. When he had spoken these
words he commanded Mercury to call all the gods to counsell, and if any
of the celestiall powers did faile of appearance he would be condemned
in ten thousand pounds: which sentence was such a terrour to all the
goddesses, that the high Theatre was replenished, and Jupiter began to
speake in this sort: O yee gods, registred in the bookes of the Muses,
you all know this young man Cupid whom I have nourished with mine owne
hands, whose raging flames of his first youth, I thought best to bridle
and restraine. It sufficeth that hee is defamed in every place for his
adulterous living, wherefore all occasion ought to bee taken away by
meane of marriage: he hath chosen a Maiden that fancieth him well, and
hath bereaved her of her virginity, let him have her still, and
possesse her according to his owne pleasure: then he returned to Venus,
and said, And you my daughter, take you no care, neither feare the
dishonour of your progeny and estate, neither have regard in that it is
a mortall marriage, for it seemeth unto me just, lawfull, and
legitimate by the law civill. Incontinently after Jupiter commanded
Mercury to bring up Psyches, the spouse of Cupid, into the Pallace of
heaven. And then he tooke a pot of immortality, and said, Hold Psyches,
and drinke, to the end thou maist be immortall, and that Cupid may be
thine everlasting husband. By and by the great banket and marriage
feast was sumptuously prepared, Cupid sate downe with his deare spouse
between his armes: Juno likewise with Jupiter, and all the other gods
in order, Ganimedes filled the pot of Jupiter, and Bacchus served the
rest. Their drinke was Nectar the wine of the gods, Vulcanus prepared
supper, the howers decked up the house with roses and other sweet
smells, the graces threw about blame, the Muses sang with sweet
harmony, Apollo tuned pleasantly to the Harpe, Venus danced finely:
Satirus and Paniscus plaid on their pipes; and thus Psyches was married
to Cupid, and after she was delivered of a child whom we call Pleasure.
This the trifling old woman declared unto the captive maiden: but I
poore Asse, not standing farre of, was not a little sorry in that I
lacked pen and inke to write so worthy a tale.
THE SIXTH BOOKE
THE TWENTY-THIRD CHAPTER
How Apuleius carried away the Gentlewoman, and how they were taken
againe by the theeves, and what a kind of death was invented for them.
By and by the theeves came home laden with treasure, and many of them
which were of strongest courage (leaving behind such as were lame and
wounded, to heale and aire themselves) said they would returne backe
againe to fetch the rest of their pillage, which they had hidden in a
certaine cave, and so they snatched up their dinner greedily, and
brought us forth into the way and beate us before them with staves.
About night (after that we had passed over many hilles and dales) we
came to a great cave, where they laded us with mighty burthens, and
would not suffer us to refresh our selves any season but brought us
againe in our way, and hied so fast homeward, that what with their
haste and their cruell stripes, I fell downe upon a stone by the way
side, then they beate me pittifully in lifting me up, and hurt my right
thigh and my left hoofe, and one of them said, What shall we do with
this lame Ill favoured Asse, that is not worth the meate he eats? And
other said, Since the time that we had him first he never did any good,
and I thinke he came unto our house with evill lucke, for we have had
great wounds since, and losse of our valiant captaines, and other said,
As soone as he hath brought home his burthen, I will surely throw him
out upon the mountaine to be a pray for wild beasts: While these
gentlemen reasoned together of my death, we fortuned to come home, for
the feare that I was in, caused my feet to turne into wings: after that
we were discharged of our burthens, they went to their fellowes that
were wounded, and told them of our great tardity and slownesse by the
way, neither was I brought into small anguish, when I perceived my
death prepared before my face: Why standest thou still Lucius? Why dost
thou not looke for thy death? Knowst thou not that the theeves have
ordained to slay thee? seest thou not these sharpe and pointed flints
which shall bruise and teare thee in peeces, if by adventure thou
happen upon them? Thy gentle Magitian hath not onely given thee the
shape and travell of an Asse, but also a skinne so soft and tender as
it were a swallow: why dost thou not take courage and runne away to
save thy selfe? Art thou afraid of the old woman more then halfe dead,
whom with a stripe of thy heele thou maist easily dispatch? But whither
shall I fly? What lodging shall I seek? See my Assy cogitation. Who is
he that passeth by the way and will not take me up? While I devised
these things, I brake the halter wherewith I was tyed and ran away with
all my force, howbeit I could not escape the kitish eyes of the old
woman, for shee ran after me, and with more audacity then becommeth her
kind age, caught me by the halter and thought to pull me home: but I
not forgetting the cruell purpose of the theeves, was mooved with small
pity, for I kicked her with my hinder heeles to the ground and had
welnigh slaine her, who (although shee was throwne and hurled downe)
yet shee held still the halter, and would not let me goe; then shee
cryed with a loud voyce and called for succour, but she little
prevayled, because there was no person that heard her, save onely the
captive gentlewoman, who hearing the voice of the old woman, came out
to see what the matter was, and perceiving her hanging at the halter,
tooke a good courage and wrested it out of her hand, and (entreating me
with gentle words) got upon my backe. Then I began to runne, and shee
gently kicked mee forward, whereof I was nothing displeased, for I had
as great a desire to escape as shee: insomuch that I seemed to scowre
away like a horse. And when the Gentlewoman did speake, I would answere
her with my neighing, and oftentimes (under colour to rub my backe) I
would sweetly kisse her tender feet. Then shee fetching a sigh from the
bottome of her heart, lifted up her eyes to the heavens, saying: O
soveraigne Gods, deliver mee if it be your pleasure, from these present
dangers: and thou cruell fortune cease thy wrath, let the sorrow
suffice thee which I have already sustained. And thou little Asse, that
art the occasion of my safety and liberty, if thou canst once render me
safe and sound to my parents, and to him that so greatly desireth to
have me to his wife, thou shalt see what thankes I will give: with what
honour I will reward thee, and how I will use thee. First, I will
bravely dresse the haires of thy forehead, and then will I finely combe
thy maine, I will tye up thy rugged tayle trimly, I will decke thee
round about with golden trappes, in such sort that thou shalt glitter
like the starres of the skie, I will bring thee daily in my apron the
kirnels of nuts, and will pamper thee up with delicates; I will set
store by thee, as by one that is the preserver of my life: Finally,
thou shalt lack no manner of thing. Moreover amongst thy glorious fare,
thy great ease, and the blisse of thy life, thou shalt not be destitute
of dignity, for thou shalt be chronicled perpetually in memory of my
present fortune, and the providence divine. All the whole history shall
be painted upon the wall of our house, thou shalt be renowned
throughout all the world. And it shall be registred in the bookes of
Doctours, that an Asse saved the life of a young maiden that was
captive amongst Theeves: Thou shalt be numbred amongst the ancient
miracles: wee beleeve that by like example of truth Phryxus saved
himselfe from drowning upon the Ram, Arion escaped upon a Dolphin, and
that Europa was delivered by the Bull. If Jupiter transformed himselfe
into a Bull, why may it not be that under the shape of this Asse, is
hidden the figure of a man, or some power divine? While that the Virgin
did thus sorrowfully unfold her desires, we fortuned to come to a place
where three wayes did meet, and shee tooke me by the halter, and would
have me to turne on the right hand to her fathers house: but I (knowing
that the theeves were gone that way to fetch the residue of their
pillage) resisted with my head as much as I might, saying within my
selfe: What wilt thou doe unhappy maiden? Why wouldst thou goe so
willingly to hell? Why wilt thou runne into destruction by meane of my
feet? Why dost thou seek thine own harme, and mine likewise? And while
we strived together whether way we might take, the theeves returned,
laiden with their pray, and perceived us a farre off by the light of
the Moon: and after they had known us, one of them gan say, Whither goe
you so hastely? Be you not afraid of spirits? And you (you harlot) doe
you not goe to see your parents? Come on, we will beare you company?
And therewithall they tooke me by the hatter, and drave me backe
againe, beating me cruelly with a great staffe (that they had) full of
knobs: then I returning againe to my ready destruction, and remembering
the griefe of my hoofe, began to shake my head, and to waxe lame, but
he that led me by the halter said, What, dost thou stumble? Canst thou
not goe? These rotten feet of thine ran well enough, but they cannot
walke: thou couldest mince it finely even now with the gentlewoman,
that thou seemedst to passe the horse Pegasus in swiftnesse. In saying
of these words they beat mee againe, that they broke a great staffe
upon mee. And when we were come almost home, we saw the old woman
hanging upon a bow of a Cipresse tree; then one of them cut downe the
bowe whereon shee hanged, and cast her into the bottome of a great
ditch: after this they bound the maiden and fell greedily to their
victuals, which the miserable old woman had prepared for them. At which
time they began to devise with themselves of our death, and how they
might be revenged; divers was the opinions of this divers number: the
first said, that hee thought best the Mayd should be burned alive: the
second said she should be throwne out to wild beasts: the third said,
she should be hanged upon a gibbet: the fourth said she should be flead
alive: thus was the death of the poore Maiden scanned betweene them
foure. But one of the theeves after every man had declared his
judgement, did speake in this manner: it is not convenient unto the
oath of our company, to suffer you to waxe more cruell then the quality
of the offence doth merit, for I would that shee should not be hanged
nor burned, nor throwne to beasts, nor dye any sodaine death, but by my
council I would have her punished according to her desert. You know
well what you have determined already of this dull Asse, that eateth
more then he is worth, that faineth lamenesse, and that was the cause
of the flying away of the Maid: my mind is that he shall be slaine to
morrow, and when all the guts and entrailes of his body is taken out,
let the Maide be sowne into his belly, then let us lay them upon a
great stone against the broiling heate of the Sunne, so they shall both
sustaine all the punishments which you have ordained: for first the
Asse shall be slaine as you have determined, and she shall have her
members torne and gnawn with wild beasts, when as she is bitten and
rent with wormes, shee shall endure the paine of the fire, when as the
broyling heat of the Sunne shall scortch and parch the belly of the
Asse, shee shall abide the gallows when the Dogs and Vultures shall
have the guts of her body hanging in their ravenous mouthes. I pray you
number all the torments which she shall suffer: First shee shall dwell
within the paunch of an Asse: secondly her nosethrilles shall receive a
carraine stinke of the beast: thirdly shee shall dye for hunger: last
of all, shee shall finde no meane to ridde her selfe from her paines,
for her hand shalt be sowen up within the skinne of the Asse: This
being said, all the Theeves consented, and when I (poore Asse) heard
and understood all their device, I did nothing else but lament and
bewayle my dead carkasse, which should be handled in such sort on the
next morrow.
THE SEVENTH BOOKE
THE TWENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER
How hee that was left behinde at Hippata did bring newes concerning the
robbery of Miloes house, came home and declared to his Company, that
all the fault was laid to one Apuleius his charge.
A soone as night was past, and the cleare Chariot of the Sunne had
spred his bright beames on every coast, came one of the company of the
theeves, (for so his and their greeting together did declare) who at
the first entry into the Cave (after hee had breathed himselfe, and was
able to speake) told these tydings unto his companions in this sort.
Sirs, as touching the house of Milo of Hippata, which we forcibly
entred and ransackt the last day, we may put away all feare and doubt
nothing at all. For after that ye by force of armes, had spoyled and
taken away all things in the house, and returned hither into our Cave;
I (thrusting my selfe amongst the presse of the people, and shewing my
selfe as though I were sad and sorrowful for the mischance) consulted
with them for the boulting out of the matter, and devising what meanes
might be wrought for the apprehension of the theeves, to the intent I
might learne and see all that was done to make relation thereof unto
you as you willed me, insomuch that the whole fact at length by
manifest and evident proofes as also by the common opinion and
judgement of the people, was laid to one Lucius Apuleius charge as
manifest author of this common robbery, who a few dayse before by false
and forged letters and colored honesty, fell so farre in favour with
this Milo, that he entertained him into his house, and received him as
a chiefe of his familiar friends, which Lucius after that he had
sojourned there a good space, and won the heart of Miloes Maid, by
fained love, did thoroughly learne the waies and doores of all the
house, and curiously viewed the cofers and chests, wherein was laid the
whole substance of Milo: neither was there small cause given to judge
him culpable, since as the very same night that this robbery was done
he fled away, and could not be found in no place: and to the intent hee
might cleane escape, and better prevent such as made hew and crie after
him, he tooke his white horse and galloped away, and after this, his
servant was found in the house, who (accused as accessary to the
fellony and escape of his Master) was committed to the common gaole,
and the next day following was cruelly scourged and tormented till hee
was welnigh dead, to the intent hee should confesse the matter, but
when they could wreast or learne no such thing of him, yet sent they
many persons after, towardes Lucius Countrey to enquire him out, and so
to take him prisoner. As he declared these things, I did greatly lament
with my selfe, to thinke of mine old and pristine estate, and what
felicity I was sometimes in, in comparison to the misery that I
presently susteined, being changed into a miserable Asse, then had I no
small occasion to remember, how the old and ancient Writers did
affirme, that fortune was starke blind without eies, because she
alwaies bestoweth her riches upon evil persons, and fooles, and
chooseth or favoureth no mortall person by judgement, but is alwaies
conversent, especially with much as if she could see, she should most
shunne, and forsake, yea and that which is more worse, she sheweth such
evill or contrary opinions in men, that the wicked doe glory with the
name of good, and contrary the good and innocent be detracted and
slandred as evill. Furthermore I, who by her great cruelty, was turned
into a foure footed Asse, in most vile and abject manner: yea, and
whose estate seemed worthily to be lamented and pittied of the most
hard and stonie hearts, was accused of theft and robbing of my deare
host Milo, which villany might rather be called parricide then theft,
yet might not I defend mine owne cause or denie the fact any way, by
reason I could not speake; howbeit least my conscience should seeme to
accuse me by reason of silence, and againe being enforced by impatience
I endevored to speake, and faine would have said, Never did I that
fact, and verely the first word, never, I cried out once or twise,
somewhat handsome, but the residue I could in no wise pronounce, but
still remaining in one voice, cried, Never, never, never, howbeit I
settled my hanging lips as round as I could to speake the residue: but
why should I further complaine of the crueltie of my fortune, since as
I was not much ashamed, by reason that my servant and my horse, was
likewise accused with me of the robbery.
While I pondered with my selfe all these things, a great care [came] to
my remembrance, touching the death, which the theeves provised for me
and the maiden, and still as I looked downe to my belly, I thought of
my poore gentlewoman that should be closed within me. And the theefe
which a little before had brought the false newes against me, drew out
of the skirt of his coate, a thousand crowns, which he had rifled from
such as hee met, and brought it into the common treasury. Then hee
carefully enquired how the residue of his companions did. To whom it
was declared that the most valiant was murdred and slaine in divers
manners, whereupon he perswaded them to remit all their affaires a
certaine season, and to seeke for other fellowes to be in their places,
that by the exercise of new lads, the terror of their martiall band
might be reduced to the old number, assuring them that such as were
unwilling, might be compelled by menaces and threatnings, and such as
were willing might be incouraged forward with reward. Further he said,
that there were some, which (seeing the profite which they had) would
forsake their base and servile estate, and rather bee contented to live
like tyrants amongst them. Moreover he declared, that for his part he
had spoken with a certaine tall man, a valiant companion, but of young
age, stout in body, and couragious in fight, whom he had fully
perswaded to exercise his idle hands, dull with slothfullnesse, to his
greater profit, and (while he might) to receive the blisse of better
Fortune, and not to hold out his sturdy arme to begge for a penny, but
rather to take as much gold and silver as hee would. Then everyone
consented, that hee that seemed so worthy to be their companion, should
be one of their company, and that they would search for others to make
up the residue of the number, whereupon he went out, and by and by
(returning againe) brought in a tall young man (as he promised) to whom
none of the residue might bee compared, for hee was higher then they by
the head, and of more bignesse in body, his beard began to burgen, but
hee was poorely apparelled, insomuch that you might see all his belly
naked. As soone as he was entred in he said, God speed yee souldiers of
Mars and my faithfull companions, I pray you make me one of your band,
and I will ensure you, that you shall have a man of singular courage
and lively audacity: for I had rather receive stripes upon my backe,
then money or gold in my hands. And as for death (which every man doth
feare) I passe nothing at all, yet thinke you not that I am an abject
or a begger, neither judge you my vertue and prowesse by ragged
clothes, for I have beene a Captaine of a great company, and subdued
all the countrey of Macedonia. I am the renowned theefe Hemes the
Thracian, whose name all countreys and nations do so greatly feare: I
am the sonne of Theron the noble theefe, nourished with humane bloud,
entertained amongst the stoutest; finally I am inheritour and follower
of all my fathers vertues, yet I lost in a short time all my company
and all my riches, by one assault, which I made upon a Factor of the
Prince, which sometime had beene Captaine of two hundred men, for
fortune was cleane against me; harken and I will tell you the whole
matter. There was a certaine man in the court of the Emperour, which
had many offices, and in great favour, who at last by the envy of
divers persons, was banished away and compelled to forsake the court:
his wife Platina, a woman of rare faith and singular shamefastnes
having borne ten children to her husband, despised all worldly Pompe
and delicacy, and determined to follow her husband, and to be partaker
of his perils and danger, wherefore shee cut off her haire, disguised
her selfe like a man, and tooke with her all her treasure, passing
through the hands of the souldiers, and the naked swords without any
feare, whereby she endured many miseries, and was partaker of much
affliction, to save the life of her husband, such was her love which
she bare unto him. And when they had escaped many perillous dangers, as
well by land as by sea, they went together towards Zacynthe, to
continue there according as fortune had appointed. But when they were
arived on the sea coast of Actium (where we in our returne from
Macedony were roving about) when night came, they returned into a house
not far distant from their ship, where they lay all night. Then we
entred in and tooke away all their substance, but verely we were in
great danger: for the good matron perceiving us incontinently by the
noise of the gate, went into the chamber, and called up every man by
his name, and likewise the neighbors that dwelled round about, insomuch
that by reason of the feare that every one was in, we hardly escaped
away, but this most holy woman, faithfull and true to her husband (as
the truth must be declared) returned to Caesar, desiring his aid and
puissance, and demanding vengeance of the injury done to her husband,
who granted all her desire: then went my company to wracke, insomuch
that every man was slaine, so great was the authority and word of the
Prince. Howbeit, when all my band was lost, and taken by search of the
Emperours army, I onely stole away and delivered my selfe from the
violence of the souldiers, for I clothed my selfe in a womans attire,
and mounted upon an Asse, that carryed barly sheafes, and (passing
through the middle of them all) I escaped away, because every one
deemed that I was a woman by reason I lacked a beard. Howbeit I left
not off for all this, nor did degenerate from the glory of my father,
or mine own vertue, but freshly comming from the bloody skirmish, and
disguised like a woman, I invaded townes and castles alone to get some
pray. And therewithall he pulled out two thousand crownes, which he had
under his coate, saying: Hold here the dowry which I present unto you,
hold eke my person, which you shall alwayes find trusty and faithfull,
if you willingly receive me: and I will ensure you that in so doing,
within short space I wilt make and turne this stony house of yours into
gold. Then by and by every one consented to make him their Captaine,
and so they gave him better garments, and threw away his old. When they
had changed his attire, hee imbraced them one after another, then
placed they him in the highest roome of the table, and drunk unto him
in token of good lucke.
THE TWENTY-FIFTH CHAPTER
How the death of the Asse, and the Gentlewoman was stayed.
After supper they began to talke, and declare unto him the going away
of the Gentlewoman, and how I bare her upon my backe, and what death
was ordained for us two. Then he desired to see her, whereupon the
Gentlewoman was brought forth fast bound, whom as soone as he beheld,
he turned himselfe wringing his nose, and blamed them saying: I am not
so much a beast, or so rash a fellow to drive you quite from your
purpose, but my conscience will not suffer me to conceale any thing
that toucheth your profit, since I am as carefull for you, howbeit if
my counsell doe displease you, you may at your liberty proceed in your
enterprise. I doubt not but all theeves, and such as have a good
judgement, will preferre their owne lucre and gain above all things in
the world, and above their vengeance, which purchaseth damage to divers
persons. Therefore if you put this virgin in the Asses belly, you shall
but execute your indignation against her, without all manner of profit;
But I would advise you to carry the virgin to some towne and to sell
her: and such a brave girle as she is, may be sold for a great quantity
of money. And I my selfe know certaine bawdy Marchants, amongst whom
peradventure one will give us summes of gold for her. This is my
opinion touching this affaire: but advise you what you intend to do,
for you may rule me in this case. In this manner the good theefe
pleaded and defended our cause, being a good Patron to the silly
virgin, and to me poore Asse. But they staied hereupon a good space,
with long deliberation, which made my heart (God wot) and spirit
greatly to quaile. Howbeit in the end they consented to his opinion,
and by and by the Maiden was unloosed of her bonds, who seeing the
young man, and hearing the name of brothels and bawdy Merchants, began
to wax joyfull, and smiled with herself. Then began I to deeme evill of
the generation of women, when as I saw the Maiden (who was appointed to
be married to a young Gentleman, and who so greatly desired the same)
was now delighted with the talke of a wicked brothel house, and other
things dishonest. In this sort the consent and manners of women
depended in the judgement of an Asse.
THE TWENTY-SIXTH CHAPTER
How all the Theeves were brought asleepe by their new companion.
Then the young man spake againe, saying, Masters, why goe wee not about
to make our prayers unto Mars, touching this selling of the Maiden, and
to seeke for other companions. But as farre as I see, here is no other
manner of beast to make sacrifice withall, nor wine sufficient for us
to drinke. Let me have (quoth hee) tenne more with me, and wee will goe
to the next Castle, to provide for meat and other things necessary. So
he and tenne more with him, went their way: In the meane season, the
residue made a great fire and an Alter with greene turfes in the honour
of Mars. By and by after they came againe, bringing with them bottles
of wine, and a great number of beasts, amongst which there was a big
Ram Goat, fat, old, and hairy, which they killed and offered unto Mars.
Then supper was prepared sumptuously, and the new companion said unto
the other, You ought to accompt me not onely your Captaine in robbery
and fight, but also in pleasures and jolity, whereupon by and by with
pleasant cheere he prepared meat, and trimming up the house he set all
things in order, and brought the pottage and dainty dishes to the
Table: but above all he plyed them wel with great pots and jugs of
wine. Sometimes (seeming to fetch somewhat) hee would goe to the Maiden
and give her pieces of meate, which he privily tooke away, and would
drinke unto her, which she willingly tooke in good part. Moreover, hee
kissed her twice or thrice whereof she was well pleased but I (not well
contented thereat) thought in my selfe: O wretched Maid, thou hast
forgotten thy marriage, and doest esteeme this stranger and bloudy
theefe above thy husband which thy Parents ordained for thee, now
perceive I well thou hast no remorse of conscience, but more delight to
tarry and play the harlot heere amongst so many swords. What? knowest
thou not how the other theeves if they knew thy demeanour would put
thee to death as they had once appointed, and so worke my destruction
likewise? Well now I perceive thou hast a pleasure in the dammage and
hurt of other. While I did angerly devise with my selfe all these
things, I perceived by certaine signes and tokens (not ignorant to so
wise an Asse) that he was not the notable theefe Hemus, but rather
Lepolemus her husband, for after much communication he beganne to
speake more franckly, not fearing at all my presence, and said, Be of
good cheere my sweete friend Charites, for thou shalt have by and by
all these thy enemies captive unto thee. Then hee filled wine to the
theeves more and more, and never ceased, till as they were all overcome
with abundance of meat and drinke, when as hee himselfe abstained and
bridled his owne appetite. And truely I did greatly suspect, least hee
had mingled in their cups some deadly poyson, for incontinently they
all fell downe asleepe on the ground one after an other, and lay as
though they had beene dead.
THE TWENTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER
How the Gentlewoman was carried home by her husband while the theeves
were asleepe, and how much Apuleius was made of.
When the theeves were all asleepe by their great and immoderate
drinking, the young man Lepolemus took the Maiden and set her upon my
backe, and went homeward. When we were come home, all the people of the
Citie, especially her Parents, friends, and family, came running forth
joyfully, and the children and Maidens of the towne gathered together
to see this virgin in great triumph sitting upon an Asse. Then I
(willing to shew as much joy as I might, as present occasion served) I
set and pricked up my long eares, ratled my nosethrils, and cryed
stoutly, nay rather I made the towne to ring againe with my shrilling
sound: when wee were come to her fathers house, shee was received in a
chamber honourably: as for me, Lepolemus (accompanied with a great
number of Citizens) did presently after drive me backe againe with
other horses to the cave of the theeves, where wee found them all
asleepe lying on the ground as wee left them; then they first brought
out all the gold, and silver, and other treasure of the house, and
laded us withall, which when they had done, they threw many of the
theeves downe into the bottome of deepe ditches, and the residue they
slew with their swords: after this wee returned home glad and merry of
so great vengeance upon them, and the riches which wee carried was
commited to the publike treasurie. This done, the Maid was married to
Lepolemus, according to the law, whom by so much travell he had
valiantly recovered: then my good Mistresse looked about for me, and
asking for me commanded the very same day of her marriage, that my
manger should be filled with barly, and that I should have hay and oats
aboundantly, and she would call me her little Camell. But how greatly
did I curse Fotis, in that shee transformed me into an Asse, and not
into a dogge, because I saw the dogges had filled their paunches with
the reliks and bones of so worthy a supper. The next day this new
wedded woman (my Mistresse) did greatly commend me before her Parents
and husband, for the kindnesse which I had shewed unto her, and never
leaved off untill such time as they promised to reward me with great
honours. Then they called together all their friends, and thus it was
concluded: one said, that I should be closed in a stable and never
worke, but continually to be fedde and fatted with fine and chosen
barly and beanes and good littour, howbeit another prevailed, who
wishing my liberty, perswaded them that it was better for me to runne
in the fields amongst the lascivious horses and mares, whereby I might
engender some mules for my Mistresse: then he that had in charge to
keepe the horse, was called for, and I was delivered unto him with
great care, insomuch that I was right pleasant and joyous, because I
hoped that I should carry no more fardels nor burthens, moreover I
thought that when I should thus be at liberty, in the spring time of
the yeere when the meddows and fields were greene, I should find some
roses in some place, whereby I was fully perswaded that if my Master
and Mistresse did render to me so many thanks and honours being an
Asse, they would much more reward me being turned into a man: but when
he (to whom the charge of me was so straightly committed) had brought
me a good way distant from the City, I perceived no delicate meates nor
no liberty which I should have, but by and by his covetous wife and
most cursed queane made me a mill Asse, and (beating me with a cudgill
full of knots) would wring bread for her selfe and her husband out of
my skinne. Yet was she not contented to weary me and make me a drudge
with carriage and grinding of her owne corne, but I was hired of her
neighbours to beare their sackes likewise, howbeit shee would not give
me such meate as I should have, nor sufficient to sustaine my life
withall, for the barly which I ground for mine owne dinner she would
sell to the Inhabitants by. And after that I had laboured all day, she
would set before me at night a little filthy branne, nothing cleane but
full of stones. Being in this calamity, yet fortune worked me other
torments, for on a day I was let loose into the fields to pasture, by
the commandement of my master. O how I leaped for joy, how I neighed to
see my selfe in such liberty, but especially since I beheld so many
Mares, which I thought should be my wives and concubines; and I espied
out and chose the fairest before I came nigh them; but this my joyfull
hope turned into otter destruction, for incontinently all the stone
Horses which were well fedde and made strong by ease of pasture, and
thereby much more puissant then a poore Asse, were jealous over me, and
(having no regard to the law and order of God Jupiter) ranne fiercely
and terribly against me; one lifted up his forefeete and kicked me
spitefully, another turned himselfe, and with his hinder heeles spurned
me cruelly, the third threatning with a malicious neighing, dressed his
eares and shewing his sharpe and white teeth bit me on every side. In
like sort have I read in Histories how the King of Thrace would throw
his miserable ghests to be torne in peeces and devoured of his wild
Horses, so niggish was that Tyrant of his provender, that he nourished
them with the bodies of men.
THE TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was made a common Asse to fetch home wood, and how he was
handled by a boy.
After that I was thus handled by horses, I was brought home againe to
the Mill, but behold fortune (insatiable of my torments) had devised a
new paine for me. I was appointed to bring home wood every day from a
high hill, and who should drive me thither and home again, but a boy
that was the veriest hangman in all the world, who was not contented
with the great travell that I tooke in climbing up the hill, neither
pleased when he saw my hoofe torne and worne away by sharpe flintes,
but he beat me cruelly with a great staffe, insomuch that the marrow of
my bones did ake for woe, for he would strike me continually on the
right hip, and still in one place, whereby he tore my skinne and made
of my wide sore a great hole or trench, or rather a window to looke out
at, and although it runne downe of blood, yet would he not cease
beating me in that place: moreover he laded me with such great burthens
of wood that you would thinke they had been rather prepared for
Elephants then for me, and when he perceived that my wood hanged more
on one side then another, (when he should rather take away the heavy
sides, and so ease me, or else lift them up to make them equall with
the other) he laid great stones upon the weaker side to remedy the
matter, yet could be not be contented with this my great misery and
immoderate burthens of wood, but when hee came to any river (as there
were many by the way) he to save his feete from water, would leape upon
my loynes likewise, which was no small loade upon loade. And if by
adversity I had fell downe in any dirty or myrie place, when he should
have pulled me out either with ropes, or lifted me up by the taile, he
would never helpe me, but lay me on from top to toe with a mighty
staffe, till he had left no haire on all my body, no not so much as on
mine eares, whereby I was compelled by force of blowes to stand up. The
same hangman boy did invent another torment for me: he gathered a great
many sharp thornes as sharp as needles and bound them together like a
fagot, and tyed them at my tayle to pricke me, then was I afflicted on
every side, for if I had indeavoured to runne away, the thornes would
have pricked me, if I had stood still, the boy would have beaten mee,
and yet the boy beate mee to make me runne, whereby I perceived that
the hangman did devise nothing else save only to kill me by some manner
of meanes, and he would sweare and threaten to do me worse harme, and
because hee might have some occasion to execute his malicious minde,
upon a day (after that I had endeavoured too much by my patience) I
lifted up my heeles and spurned him welfavouredly. Then he invented
this vengeance against me, after that he had well laded me with shrubs
and rubble, and trussed it round upon my backe, hee brought me out into
the way: then hee stole a burning coale out of a mans house of the next
village, and put it into the middle of the rubbell; the rubbell and
shrubs being very dry, did fall on a light fire and burned me on every
side. I could see no remedy how I might save my selfe, and in such a
case it was not best for me to stand still but fortune was favourable
towards me, perhaps to reserve me for more dangers, for I espyed a
great hole full of raine water that fell the day before, thither I
ranne hastily and plunged my selfe therein, in such sort that I
quenched the fire, and was delivered from that present perill, but the
vile boy to excuse himselfe declared to all the neighbours and
shepheards about, that I willingly tumbled in the fire as I passed
through the village. Then he laughed upon me saying: How long shall we
nourish and keepe this fiery Asse in vaine?
THE TWENTY-NINTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was accused of Lechery by the boy.
A few dayes after, the boy invented another mischiefe: For when he had
sold all the wood which I bare, to certaine men dwelling in a village
by, he lead me homeward unladen: And then he cryed that he was not able
to rule me, and that hee would not drive mee any longer to the hill for
wood, saying: Doe you not see this slow and dulle Asse, who besides all
the mischiefes that he hath wrought already, inventeth daily more and
more. For he espyeth any woman passing by the way, whether she be old
or marryed, or if it be a young child, hee will throw his burthen from
his backe, and runneth fiercely upon them. And after that he hath
thrown them downe, he will stride over them to commit his buggery and
beastly pleasure, moreover hee will faine as though hee would kisse
them, but he will bite their faces cruelly, which thing may worke us
great displeasure, or rather to be imputed unto us as a crime: and even
now when he espyed an honest maiden passing by the high way, he by and
by threw downe his wood and runne after her: And when he had throwne
her down upon the ground, he would have ravished her before the face of
all the world, had it not beene that by reason of her crying out, she
was succored and pulled from his heeles, and so delivered. And if it
had so come to passe that this fearefull maid had beene slaine by him,
what danger had we beene in? By these and like lies, he provoked the
shepheards earnestly against me, which grieved mee (God wot) full sore
that said nothing. Then one of the shepheards said: Why doe we not make
sacrifice of this common adulterous Asse? My sonne (quoth he) let us
kill him and throw his guts to the dogges, and reserve his flesh for
the labourers supper. Then let us cast dust upon his skinne, and carry
it home to our master, and say that the Woolves have devoured him. The
boy that was my evill accuser made no delay, but prepared himselfe to
execute the sentence of the shepheard, rejoycing at my present danger,
but O how greatly did I then repent that the stripe which I gave him
with my heele had not killed him. Then he drew out his sword and made
it sharp upon the whetstone to slay me, but another of the shepheards
gan say, Verely it is a great offence to kill so faire an Asse, and so
(by accusation of luxurie and lascivious wantonnesse) to lack so
necessarie his labour and service, where otherwise if ye would cut off
his stones, he might not onely be deprived of his courage but also
become gentle, that we should be delivered from all feare and danger.
Moreover he would be thereby more fat and better in flesh. For I know
my selfe as well many Asses, as also most fierce horses, that by reason
of their wantonnesse have beene most mad and terrible, but (when they
were gelded and cut) they have become gentle and tame, and tractable to
all use. Wherefore I would counsell you to geld him. And if you consent
thereto, I will by and by, when I go to the next market fetch mine
irons and tooles for the purpose: And I ensure you after that I have
gelded and cut off his stones, I will deliver him unto you as tame as a
lambe. When I did perceive that I was delivered from death, and
reserved to be gelded, I was greatly sorrie, insomuch that I thought
all the hinder part of my body and my stones did ake for woe, but I
sought about to kill my selfe by some manner of meanes, to the end if I
should die, I would die with unperished members.
THE THIRTIETH CHAPTER
How the boy that lead Apuleius to the field, was slaine in the wood.
While I devised with my selfe in what manner I might end my life, the
roperipe boy on the next morrow lead me to the same hill againe, and
tied me to a bow of a great Oke, and in the meane season he tooke his
hatchet and cut wood to load me withall, but behold there crept out of
a cave by, a marvailous great Beare, holding out his mighty head, whom
when I saw, I was sodainly stroken in feare, and (throwing all the
strength of my body into my hinder heeles) lifted up my strained head
and brake the halter, wherewith I was tied. Then there was no need to
bid me runne away, for I scoured not only on foot, but tumbled over the
stones and rocks with my body till I came into the open fields, to the
intent I would escape from the terrible Beare, but especially from the
boy that was worse than the Beare. Then a certaine stranger that passed
by the way (espying me alone as a stray Asse) tooke me up and roade
upon my backe, beating me with a staffe (which he bare in his hand)
through a wide and unknowne lane, whereat I was nothing displeased, but
willingly went forward to avoid the cruell paine of gelding, which the
shepherds had ordained for me, but as for the stripes I was nothing
moved, since I was accustomed to be beaten so every day. But evill
fortune would not suffer me to continue in so good estate long: For the
shepheards looking about for a Cow that they had lost (after they had
sought in divers places) fortuned to come upon us unwares, who when
they espied and knew me, they would have taken me by the halter, but he
that rode upon my backe resisted them saying, O Lord masters, what
intend you to do? Will you rob me? Then said the shepheards, What?
thinkest thou we handle thee otherwise then thou deservest, which hast
stollen away our Asse? Why dost thou not rather tell us where thou hast
hidden the boy whom thou hast slaine? And therewithall they pulled him
downe to the ground, beating him with their fists, and spurning him
with their feete. Then he answered unto them saying, that he saw no
manner of boy, but onely found the Asse loose and straying abroad,
which he tooke up to the intent to have some reward for the finding of
him and to restore him againe to his Master. And I would to God (quoth
he) that this Asse (which verely was never seene) could speake as a man
to give witnesse of mine innocency: Then would you be ashamed of the
injury which you have done to me. Thus (reasoning for Himselfe) he
nothing prevailed, for they tied the halter about my necke, and (maugre
his face) pulled me quite away, and lead me backe againe through the
woods of the hill to the place where the boy accustomed to resort. And
after they could find him in no place, at length they found his body
rent and torne in peeces, and his members dispersed in sundry places,
which I well knew was done by the cruell Beare: and verely I would have
told it if I might have spoken, but (which I could onely do) I greatly
rejoiced at his death, although it came too late. Then they gathered
together the peeces of his body and buried them. By and by they laid
the fault to my new Master, that tooke me up by the way, and (bringing
him home fast bound to their houses) purposed on the next morrow to
accuse him of murther, and to lead him before the Justices to have
judgement of death.
THE THIRTY-FIRST CHAPTER
How Apuleius was cruelly beaten by the Mother of the boy that was
slaine.
In the meane season, while the Parents of the boy did lament and weepe
for the death of their sonne, the shepheard (according to his promise)
came with his instruments and tooles to geld me. Then one of them said,
Tush we little esteeme the mischiefe he did yesterday, but now we are
contented that to morrow his stones shall not onely be cut off, but
also his head. So was it brought to passe, that my death was delayed
till the next morrow, but what thanks did I give to that good boy, who
(being so slaine) was the cause of my pardon for one short day. Howbeit
I had no time then to rest my selfe, for the Mother of the boy, weeping
and lamenting for his death, attired in mourning vesture, tare her
haire and beat her breast, and came presently into the stable, saying,
Is it reason that this carelesse beast should do nothing all day but
hold his head in the manger, filling and belling his guts with meat
without compassion of my great miserie, or remembrance of the pittiful
death of his slaine Master: and contemning my age and infirmity,
thinketh that I am unable to revenge his mischiefs, moreover he would
perswade me, that he were not culpable. Indeed, it is a convenient
thing to looke and plead for safety, when as the conscience doeth
confesse the offence, as theeves and malefactors accustome to do. But O
good Lord, thou cursed beast, if thou couldest utter the contents of
thine owne mind, whom (though it were the veriest foole in all the
world) mightest thou perswade that this murther was voide or without
thy fault, when as it lay in thy power, either to keepe off the theeves
with thy heeles, or else to bite and teare them with thy teeth?
Couldest not thou (that so often in his life time diddest spurne and
kicke him) defend him now at the point of death by the like meane? Yet
at least, thou shouldest have taken him upon thy backe, and so brought
him from the cruell hands of the theeves: where contrary thou runnest
away alone, forsaking thy good Master, thy pastor and conductor.
Knowest thou not, that such as denie their wholsome help and aid to
them which lie in danger of death, ought to be punished, because they
have offended against good manners, and the law naturall? But I promise
thee, thou shalt not long rejoyce at my harmes, thou shalt feele the
smart of thy homicide and offence, I will see what I can doe. And
therewithall she unclosed her apron, and bound all my feete together,
to the end I might not help my selfe, then she tooke a great barre,
which accustomed to bar the stable doore, and never ceased beating me
till she was so weary that the bar fell out of her hands, whereupon she
(complaining of the soone faintnesse of her armes) ran to her fire and
brought a firebrand and thrust it under my taile, burning me
continually, till such time as (having but one remedy) I arayed her
face and eies with my durty dunge, whereby (what with the stinke
thereof, and what with the filthinesse that fell in her eies) she was
welnigh blinded: so I enforced the queane to leave off, otherwise I had
died as Meleager did by the sticke, which his mad mother Althea cast
into the fire.
THE EIGHTH BOOKE
THE THIRTY-SECOND CHAPTER
How a young man came and declared the miserable death of Lepolemus and
his wife Charites.
About midnight came a young man, which seemed to be one of the family
of the good woman Charites, who sometimes endured so much misery and
calamity with mee amongst the theeves, who after that hee had taken a
stoole, and sate downe before the fireside, in the company of the
servants, began to declare many terrible things that had happened unto
the house of Charites, saying: O yee house-keepers, shepheards and
cowheards, you shall understand that wee have lost our good mistris
Charites miserably and by evill adventure: and to the end you may
learne and know all the whole matter, I purpose to tell you the
circumstances of every point, whereby such as are more learned then I
(to whom fortune hath ministred more copious stile) may painte it out
in paper in forme of an History. There was a young Gentleman dwelling
in the next City, borne of good parentage, valiant in prowesse, and
riche in substance, but very much given and adicted to whorehunting,
and continuall revelling. Whereby he fell in company with Theeves, and
had his hand ready to the effusion of humane blood; his name was
Thrasillus. The matter was this according to the report of every man.
Hee demanded Charites in marriage, who although he were a man more
comely then the residue that wooed her, and also had riches abundantly,
yet because he was of evill fame, and a man of wicked manners and
conversation, he had the repulse and was put off by Charites, and so
she married with Lepolemus. Howbeit this young man secretly loved her,
yet moved somewhat at her refusall, hee busily searched some meanes to
worke his damnable intent. And (having found occasion and opportunity
to accomplish his purpose, which he had long time concealed) brought to
passe, that the same day that Charites was delivered by the subtill
meane and valiant audacity of her husband, from the puissance of the
Theeves, he mingled himselfe among the assembly, faining that he was
glad of the new marriage, and comming home againe of the maiden,
Whereby (by reason that he came of so noble parents) he was received
and entertained into the house as one of their chiefe and principall
friends: Howbeit under cloake of a faithfull welwiller, hee dissimuled
his mischievous mind and intent: in continuance of time by much
familiarity and often conversation and banketting together, he fell
more and more in favour, like as we see it fortuneth to Lovers, who
first doe little delight themselves in love: till as by continuall
acquaintance they kisse and imbrace each other. Thrasillus perceiving
that it was a hard matter to breake his minde secretly to Charites,
whereby he was wholly barred from the accomplishment of his luxurious
appetite, and on the other side perceiving that the love of her and her
husband was so strongly lincked together, that the bond betweene them
might in no wise be dissevered, moreover, it was a thing impossible to
ravish her, although he had consented thereto, yet was hee still
provoked forward by vehement lust, when as hee saw himselfe unable to
bring his purpose to passe. Howbeit at length the thing which seemed so
hard and difficill, thorough hope of his fortified love, did now
appeare easie and facill: but marke I pray you diligently to what end
the furious force of his inordinate desire came. On a day Lepolemus
went to the chase with Thrasillus, to hunt for Goates, for his wife
Charites desired him earnestly to meddle with no other beasts, which
were of more fierce and wilde nature. When they were come within the
chase to a great thicket fortressed about with bryers and thornes, they
compassed round with their Dogs and beset every place with nets: by and
by warning was given to let loose. The Dogs rushed in with such a cry,
that all the Forrest rang againe with the noyse, but behold there
leaped out no Goat, nor Deere, nor gentle Hinde, but an horrible and
dangerous wild Boare, hard and thicke skinned, bristeled terribly with
thornes, foming at the mouth, grinding his teeth, and looking direfully
with fiery eyes. The Dogs that first set upon him, he tare and rent
with his tuskes, and then he ranne quite through the nets, and escaped
away. When wee saw the fury of this beast, wee were greatly striken
with feare, and because wee never accustomed to chase such dreadfull
Boares, and further because we were unarmed and without weapons, we got
and hid our selves under bushes and trees. Then Thrasillus having found
opportunity to worke his treason, said to Lepolemus: What stand we here
amazed? Why show we our selves like dastards? Why leese we so worthy a
prey with our feminine hearts? Let us mount upon our Horses, and pursue
him incontinently: take you a hunting staffe, and I will take a chasing
speare. By and by they leaped upon their Horses, and followed the
beast. But hee returning against them with furious force, pryed with
his eyes, on whom hee might first assayle with his tuskes: Lepolemus
strooke the beast first on the backe with his hunting staffe.
Thrasillus faining to ayde and assist him, came behind, and cut off the
hinder legges of Lepolemus Horse, in such sort that hee fell downe to
the ground with his master: and sodainely the Boare came upon Lepolemus
and furiously tare and rent him with his teeth. Howbeit, Thrasillus was
not sufficed to see him thus wounded, but when he desired his friendly
help, he thrust Lepolemus through the right thigh with his speare, the
more because he thought the wound of the speare would be taken for a
wound of the Boars teeth, then he killed the beast likewise, And when
he was thus miserably slaine, every one of us came out of our holes,
and went towards our slaine master. But although that Thrasillus was
joyfull of the death of Lepolemus, whom he did greatly hate, yet he
cloked the matter with a sorrowfull countenance, he fained a dolorous
face, he often imbraced the body which himselfe slew, he played all the
parts of a mourning person, saving there fell no teares from his eyes.
Thus hee resembled us in each point, who verily and not without
occasion had cause to lament for our master, laying all the blame of
this homicide unto the Boare. Incontinently after the sorrowfull newes
of the death of Lepolemus, came to the eares of all the family, but
especially to Charites, who after she had heard such pitifull tydings,
as a mad and raging woman, ran up and down the streets, crying and
howling lamentably. All the Citizens gathered together, and such as
they met bare them company running towards the chasse. When they came
to the slaine body of Lepolemus, Charites threw her selfe upon him
weeping and lamenting grievously for his death, in such sort, that she
would have presently ended her life, upon the corps of her slaine
husband, whom shee so entirely loved, had it not beene that her parents
and friends did comfort her, and pulled her away. The body was taken
up, and in funerall pompe brought to the City and buried. In the meane
season, Thrasillus fained much sorrow for the death of Lepolemus, but
in his heart he was well pleased and joyfull. And to counterfeit the
matter, he would come to Charites and say: O what a losse have I had of
my friend, my fellow, my companion Lepolemus? O Charites comfort your
selfe, pacifie your dolour, refraine your weeping, beat not your
breasts: and with such other and like words and divers examples he
endeavoured to suppresse her great sorrow, but he spake not this for
any other intent but to win the heart of the woman, and to nourish his
odious love with filthy delight. Howbeit Charites after the buriall of
her husband sought the meanes to follow him, and (not sustaining the
sorrows wherein she was Wrapped) got her secretly into a chamber and
purposed to finish her life there with dolour and tribulation. But
Thrasillus was very importunate, and at length brought to passe, that
at the intercession of the Parents and friends of Charites, she
somewhat refreshed her fallen members with refection of meate and
baine. Howbeit, she did it more at the commandement of her Parents,
then for any thing else: for she could in no wise be merry, nor receive
any comfort, but tormented her selfe day and night before the Image of
her husband which she made like unto Bacchus, and rendred unto him
divine honours and services. In the meane season Thrasillus not able to
refraine any longer, before Charites had asswaged her dolor, before her
troubled mind had pacified her fury, even in the middle of all her
griefes, while she tare her haire and rent her garments, demanded her
in marriage, and so without shame, he detected the secrets and
unspeakeable deceipts of his heart. But Charites detested and abhorred
his demand, and as she had beene stroken with some clap of thunder,
with some storme, or with the lightning of Jupiter, she presently fell
downe to the ground all amazed. Howbeit when her spirits were revived
and that she returned to her selfe, perceiving that Thrasillus was so
importunate, she demanded respite to deliberate and to take advise on
the matter. In the meane season, the shape of Lepolemus that was slaine
so miserably, appeared to Charites saying, O my sweet wife (which no
other person can say but I) I pray thee for the love which is betweene
us two, if there be any memorie of me in thy heart, or remembrance of
my pittifull death, marry with any other person, so that thou marry not
with the traitour Thrasillus, have no conference with him, eate not
with him, lie not with him, avoid the bloudie hand of mine enemie,
couple not thy selfe with a paricide, for those wounds (the bloud
whereof thy teares did wash away) were not the wounds of the teeth of
the Boare, but the speare of Thrasillus, that deprived me from thee.
Thus spake Lepolemus, unto his loving wife, and declared the residue of
the damnable fact. Then Charites, awaking from sleepe, began to renew
her dolour, to teare her garments, and to beate her armes with her
comely hands, howbeit she revealed the vision which she saw to no
manner of person, but dissimuling that she knew no part of the
mischiefe, devised with her selfe how she might be revenged on the
traitor, and finish her owne life to end and knit up all sorrow.
Incontinently came Thrasillus, the detestable demander of sodaine
pleasure, and wearied the closed eares of Charites with talke of
marriage, but she gently refused his communication, and coloring the
matter, with passing craft in the middest of his earnest desires gan
say, Thrasillus you shall understand that yet the face of your brother
and my husband, is alwayes before mine eies, I smell yet the Cinamon
sent of his pretious body, I yet feele Lepolemus alive in my heart:
wherefore you shall do well if you grant to me miserable woman,
necessarie time to bewaile his death, that after the residue of a few
months, the whole yeare may be expired, which thing toucheth as well my
shame as your wholsome profit, lest peradventure by your speed and
quicke marriage we should justly raise and provoke the spirit of my
husband to worke our destruction. Howbeit, Thrasillus was not contented
with this promise, but more and more came upon her: Insomuch, that she
was enforced to speake to him in this manner: My friend Thrasillus, if
thou be so contented untill the whole yeare be compleate and finished,
behold here is my bodie, take thy pleasure, but in such sort and so
secret that no servant of the house may perceive it. Then Thrasillus
trusting to the false promises of the woman, and preferring his
inordinate pleasure above all things in the world, was joyfull in his
heart and looked for night, when as he might have his purpose. But come
thou about midnight (quoth Charites) disguised without companie, and
doe but hisse at my chamber doore, and my nourse shall attend and let
thee in. This counsell pleased Thrasillus marveilously, who (suspecting
no harme) did alwaies looke for night, and the houre assigned by
Charites. The time was scarce come, when as (according to her
commandement) he disguised himselfe, and went straight to the chamber,
where he found the nourse attending for him, who (by the appointment of
her Mistresse) fed him with flattering talke, and gave him mingled and
doled drinke in a cup, excusing the absence of her Mistresse Charites,
by reason that she attended on her Father being sick, untill such time,
that with sweet talke and operation of the wine, he fell in a sound
sleepe: Now when he lay prostrate on the ground readie to all
adventure, Charites (being called for) came in, and with manly courage
and bold force stood over the sleeping murderer, saying: Behold the
faithfull companion of my husband, behold this valiant hunter; behold
me deere spouse, this is the hand which shed my bloud, this is the
heart which hath devised so many subtill meanes to worke my
destruction, these be the eies whom I have ill pleased, behold now they
foreshew their owne destinie: sleepe carelesse, dreame that thou art in
the hands of the mercifull, for I will not hurt thee with thy sword or
any other weapon: God forbid that I should slay thee as thou slewest my
husband, but thy eies shall faile thee, and thou shalt see no more,
then that whereof thou dreamest: Thou shalt thinke the death of thine
enemie more sweet then thy life: Thou shalt see no light, thou shalt
lacke the aide of a leader, thou shalt not have me as thou hopest, thou
shalt have no delight of my marriage, thou shalt not die, and yet
living thou shalt have no joy, but wander betweene light and darknesse
as an unsure Image: thou shalt seeke for the hand that pricked out
thine eies, yet shalt thou not know of whom thou shouldest complaine: I
will make sacrifice with the bloud of thine eies upon the grave of my
husband. But what gainest thou through my delay? Perhaps thou dreamest
that thou embracest me in thy armes: leave off the darknesse of sleepe
and awake thou to receive a penall deprivation of thy sight, lift up
thy face, regard thy vengeance and evill fortune, reckon thy miserie;
so pleaseth thine eies to a chast woman, that thou shall have
blindnesse to thy companion, and an everlasting remorse of thy
miserable conscience. When she had spoken these words, she tooke a
great needle from her head and pricked out both his eies: which done,
she by and by caught the naked sword which her husband Lepolemus
accustomed to weare, and ranne throughout all the Citie like a mad
woman towards the Sepulchre of her husband. Then all we of the house,
with all the Citizens, ranne incontinently after her to take the sword
out of her hand, but she clasping about the tombe of Lepolemus, kept us
off with her naked weapon, and when she perceived that every one of us
wept and lamented, she spake in this sort: I pray you my friends weepe
not, nor lament for me, for I have revenged the death of my husband, I
have punished deservedly the wicked breaker of our marriage; now is it
time to seeke out my sweet Lepolemus, and presently with this sword to
finish my life. And therewithall after she had made relation of the
whole matter, declared the vision which she saw and told by what meane
she deceived Thrasillus, thrusting her sword under her right brest, and
wallowing in her owne bloud, at length with manly courage yeelded up
the Ghost. Then immediately the friends of miserable Charites did bury
her body within the same Sepulchre. Thrasillus hearing all the matter,
and knowing not by what meanes he might end his life, for he thought
his sword was not sufficient to revenge so great a crime, at length
went to the same Sepulchre, and cryed with a lowd voice, saying: o yee
dead spirites whom I have so highly and greatly offended, vouchsafe to
receive me, behold I make Sacrifice unto you with my whole body: which
said, hee closed the Sepulchre, purposing to famish himselfe, and to
finish his life there in sorrow. These things the young man with
pitifull sighes and teares, declared unto the Cowheards and Shepheards,
which caused them all to weepe: but they fearing to become subject unto
new masters, prepared themselves to depart away.
THE THIRTY-THIRD CHAPTER
How Apuleius was lead away by the Horsekeeper: and what danger he was
in.
By and by the Horsekeeper, to whom the charge of me was committed,
brought forth all his substance, and laded me and other Horses withall,
and so departed thence: we bare women, children, pullets, sparrowes,
kiddes, whelpes, and other things which were not able to keepe pace
with us, and that which I bare upon my backe, although it was a mighty
burthen, yet seemed it very light because I was driven away from him
that most terribly had appointed to kill me. When we had passed over a
great mountaine full of trees, and were come againe into the open
fields, behold we approached nigh to a faire and rich Castell, where it
was told unto us that we were not able to passe in our journey that
night, by reason of the great number of terrible Wolves which were in
the Country about, so fierce and cruell that they put every man in
feare, in such sort that they would invade and set upon such which
passed by like theeves, and devoure both them and their beasts.
Moreover, we were advertised that there lay in the way where we should
passe, many dead bodies eaten and torne with wolves. Wherefore we were
willed to stay there all night, and on the next morning, to goe close
and round together, whereby we might passe and escape all dangers. But
(notwithstanding this good counsell) our caitife drivers were so
covetous to goe forward, and so fearefull of pursuite, that they never
stayed till the morning: But being welnigh midnight, they made us
trudge in our way apace. Then I fearing the great danger which might
happen, ran amongst the middle of the other Horses, to the end I might
defend and save my poore buttocks from the Wolves, whereat every man
much marvelled to see, that I scowred away swifter then the other
Horses. But such was my agility, not to get me any prayse, but rather
for feare: at that time I remembered with my selfe, that the valiant
Horse Pegasus did fly in the ayre more to avoyd the danger of dreadful
Chimera, then for any thing else. The shepheards which drave us before
them were well armed like warriours: one had a speare, another had a
sheepehooke, some had darts, some clubbes, some gathered up great
stones, some held up their sharp Javelings, and some feared away the
Woolves with light firebrands. Finally wee lacked nothing to make up an
Army, but onely Drummes and Trumpets. But when we had passed these
dangers, not without small feare, wee fortuned to fall into worse, for
the Woolves came not upon us, either because of the great multitude of
our company, or else because [of] our firebrands, or peradventure they
were gone to some other place, for wee could see none, but the
Inhabitants of the next villages (supposing that wee were Theeves by
reason of the great multitude) for the defence of their owne substance,
and for the feare that they were in, set great and mighty masties upon
us, which they had kept and nourished for the safety of their houses,
who compassing us round about leaped on every side, tearing us with
their teeth, in such sort that they pulled many of us to the ground:
verily it was a pittifull sight to see so many Dogs, some following
such as flyed, some invading such as stood still, some tearing those
which lay prostrate, but generally there were none which escaped
cleare: Behold upon this another danger ensued, the Inhabitants of the
Towne stood in their garrets and windowes, throwing great stones upon
our heads, that wee could not tell whether it were best for us to avoyd
the gaping mouthes of the Dogges at hand or the perill of the stones
afarre, amongst whome there was one that hurled a great flint upon a
woman, which sate upon my backe, who cryed out pitiously, desiring her
husband to helpe her. Then he (comming to succour and ayd his wife)
beganne to speake in this sort: Alas masters, what mean you to trouble
us poore labouring men so cruelly? What meane you to revenge your
selves upon us, that doe you no harme? What thinke you to gaine by us?
You dwell not in Caves or Dennes: you are no people barbarous, that you
should delight in effusion of humane blood. At these words the tempest
of stones did cease, and the storme of the Dogges vanished away. Then
one (standing on the toppe of a great Cypresse tree) spake unto us
saying: Thinke you not masters that we doe this to the intent to rifle
or take away any of your goods, but for the safeguard of our selves and
family: now a Gods name you may depart away. So we went forward, some
wounded with stones, some bitten with Dogs, but generally there was
none which escaped free.
THE THIRTY-FOURTH CHAPTER
How the shepheards determined to abide in a certaine wood to cure their
wounds.
When we had gone a good part of our way, we came to a certaine wood
invironed with great trees and compassed about with pleasant meddowes,
whereas the Shepheards appointed to continue a certaine space to cure
their wounds and sores; then they sate downe on the ground to refresh
their wearie minds, and afterwards they sought for medicines, to heale
their bodies: some washed away their blood with the water of the
running River: some stopped their wounds with Spunges and cloutes, in
this manner every one provided for his owne safety. In the meane season
wee perceived an old man, who seemed to be a Shepheard, by reason of
the Goates and Sheep that fed round about him. Then one of our company
demanded whether he had any milke, butter, or cheese to sell. To whom
he made answere saying: Doe you looke for any meate or drinke, or any
other refection here? Know you not in what place you be?
And therewithall he tooke his sheepe and drave them away as fast as he
might possible. This answere made our shepheards greatly to feare, that
they thought of nothing else, but to enquire what Country they were in:
Howbeit they saw no manner of person of whom they might demand. At
length as they were thus in doubt, they perceived another old man with
a staffe in his hand very weary with travell, who approaching nigh to
our company, began to weepe and complaine saying: Alas masters I pray
you succour me miserable caitife, and restore my nephew to me againe,
that by following a sparrow that flew before him, is fallen into a
ditch hereby, and verily I thinke he is in danger of death. As for me,
I am not able to helpe him out by reason of mine old age, but you that
are so valiant and lusty may easily helpe me herein, and deliver me my
boy, my heire and guide of my life. These words made us all to pity
him. And then the youngest and stoutest of our company, who alone
escaped best the late skirmish of Dogges and stones, rose up and
demanded in what ditch the boy was fallen: Mary (quod he) yonder, and
pointed with his finger, and brought him to a great thicket of bushes
and thornes where they both entred in. In the meane season, after we
cured our wounds, we tooke up our packs, purposing to depart away. And
because we would not goe away without the young man our fellow: The
shepheards whistled and called for him, but when he gave no answer,
they sent one out of their company to seeke him out, who after a while
returned againe with a pale face and sorrowfull newes, saying that he
saw a terrible Dragon eating and devouring their companion: and as for
the old man, hee could see him in no place. When they heard this,
(remembring likewise the words of the first old man that shaked his
head, and drave away his sheep) they ran away beating us before them,
to fly from this desart and pestilent Country.
THE THIRTY-FIFTH CHAPTER
How a woman killed her selfe and her child, because her husband haunted
harlots.
After that we had passed a great part of our journey, we came to a
village where we lay all night, but harken, and I will tell you what
mischiefe happened there: you shall understand there was a servant to
whom his Master had committed the whole government of his house, and
was Master of the lodging where we lay: this servant had married a
Maiden of the same house, howbeit he was greatly in love with a harlot
of the towne, and accustomed to resort unto her, wherewith his wife was
so highly displeased and became so jealous, that she gathered together
all her husbands substance, with his tales and books of account, and
threw them into a light fire: she was not contented with this, but she
tooke a cord and bound her child which she had by her husband, about
her middle and cast her selfe headlong into a deepe pit. The Master
taking in evill part the death of these twaine, tooke his servant which
was the cause of this murther by his luxurie, and first after that he
had put off all his apparell, he annointed his body with honey, and
then bound him sure to a fig-tree, where in a rotten stocke a great
number of Pismares had builded their neasts, the Pismares after they
had felt the sweetnesse of the honey came upon his body, and by little
and little (in continuance of time) devoured all his flesh, in such
sort, that there remained on the tree but his bare bones: this was
declared unto us by the inhabitants of the village there, who greatly
sorrowed for the death of this servant: then we avoiding likewise from
this dreadfull lodging incontinently departed away.
THE THIRTY-SIXTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was cheapned by divers persons, and how they looked in his
mouth to know his age.
After this we came to a faire Citie very populous, where our shepheards
determined to continue, by reason that it seemed a place where they
might live unknowne, far from such as should pursue them, and because
it was a countrey very plentifull of corne and other victuals, where
when we had remained the space of three dayes, and that I poore Asse
and the other horses were fed and kept in the stable to the intent we
might seeme more saleable, we were brought out at length to the market,
and by and by a crier sounded with his horne to notifie that we were to
be sold: all my companion horses were bought up by Gentlemen, but as
for me I stood still forsaken of all men. And when many buiers came by
and looked in my mouth to know mine age, I was so weary with opening my
jawes that at length (unable to endure any longer) when one came with a
stinking paire of hands and grated my gummes with his filthy fingers, I
bit them cleane off, which thing caused the standers by to forsake me
as being a fierce and cruell beast: the crier when he had gotten a
hoarse voice with crying, and saw that no man would buy me, began to
mocke me saying, To what end stand we here with this wilde Asse, this
feeble beast, this slow jade with worne hooves, good for nothing but to
make sives of his skin? Why do we not give him to some body for he
earneth not his hay? In this manner he made all the standers by to
laugh exceedingly, but my evill fortune which was ever so cruell
against me, whom I by travell of so many countreys could in no wise
escape, did more and more envie me, with invention of new meanes to
afflict my poore body in giving me a new Master as spitefull as the
rest. There was an old man somewhat bald, with long and gray haire, one
of the number of those that go from door to door, throughout all the
villages, bearing the Image of the goddesse Syria, and playing with
Cimbals to get the almes of good and charitable folks, this old man
came hastely towards the cryer, and demanded where I was bred: Marry
(quoth he) in Cappadocia: Then he enquired what age I was of, the cryer
answered as a Mathematician, which disposed to me my Planets, that I
was five yeares old, and willed the old man to looke in my mouth: For I
would not willingly (quoth he) incur the penalty of the law Cornelia,
in selling a free Citizen for a servile slave, buy a Gods name this
faire beast to ride home on, and about in the countrey: But this
curious buier did never stint to question of my qualities, and at
length he demanded whether I were gentle or no: Gentle (quoth the
crier) as gentle as a Lambe, tractable to all use, he will never bite,
he will never kicke, but you would rather thinke that under the shape
of an Asse there were some well advised man, which verely you may
easily conject, for if you would thrust your nose in his taile you
shall perceive how patient he is: Thus the cryer mocked the old man,
but he perceiving his taunts and jests, waxed very angry saying, Away
doting cryer, I pray the omnipotent and omniparent goddesse Syria,
Saint Sabod, Bellona, with her mother Idea, and Venus, with Adonis, to
strike out both thine eies, that with taunting mocks hast scoffed me in
this sort: Dost thou thinke that I will put a goddesse upon the backe
of any fierce beast, whereby her divine Image should be throwne downe
on the ground, and so I poore miser should be compelled (tearing my
haire) to looke for some Physition to helpe her? When I heard him
speake thus, I thought with my selfe sodainly to leap upon him like a
mad Asse, to the intent he should not buy me, but incontinently there
came another Marchant that prevented my thought, and offered 17 Pence
for me, then my Master was glad and received the money, and delivered
me to my new Master who was called Phelibus, and he caried his new
servant home, and before he came to his house, he called out his
daughters saying, Behold my daughters, what a gentle servant I have
bought for you: then they were marvailous glad, and comming out
pratling and shouting for joy, thought verely that he had brought home
a fit and conveniable servant for their purpose, but when they
perceived that it was an Asse, they began to provoke him, saying that
he had not bought a servant for his Maidens, but rather an Asse for
himselfe. Howbeit (quoth they) keepe him not wholly for your owne
riding, but let us likewise have him at commandement. Therewithall they
led me into the stable, and tied me to the manger: there was a certaine
yong man with a mighty body, wel skilled in playing on instruments
before the gods to get money, who (as soone as he had espied me)
entertained me verie well, for he filled my racke and maunger full of
meat, and spake merrily saying, O master Asse, you are very welcome,
now you shall take my office in hand, you are come to supply my roome,
and to ease me of my miserable labour: but I pray God thou maist long
live and please my Master well, to the end thou maist continually
deliver me from so great paine. When I heard these words I did
prognosticate my miserie to come.
The day following I saw there a great number of persons apparelled in
divers colours, having painted faces, mitres on their heads, vestiments
coloured like saffron, Surplesses of silke, and on their feet yellow
shooes, who attired the goddesse in a robe of Purple, and put her upon
my backe. Then they went forth with their armes naked to their
shoulders, bearing with them great swords and mightie axes, and dancing
like mad persons. After that we had passed many small villages, we
fortuned to come to one Britunis house, where at our first entrie they
began to hurle themselves hither and thither, as though they were mad.
They made a thousand gestures with their feete and their hands, they
would bite themselves, finally, every one tooke his weapon and wounded
his armes in divers places.
Amongst whom there was one more mad then the rest, that let many deepe
sighes from the bottome of his heart, as though he had beene ravished
in spirite, or replenished with divine power. And after that, he
somewhat returning to himselfe, invented and forged a great lye,
saying, that he had displeased the divine majesty of the goddesse, by
doing of some thing which was not convenable to the order of their holy
religion, wherefore he would doe vengeance of himselfe: and
therewithall he tooke a whip, and scourged his owne body, that the
bloud issued out aboundantly, which thing caused me greatly to feare,
to see such wounds and effusion of bloud, least the same goddesse
desiring so much the bloud of men, should likewise desire the bloud of
an Asse. After they were wearie with hurling and beating themselves,
they sate downe, and behold, the inhabitants came in, and offered gold,
silver, vessels of wine, milke, cheese, flower, wheate and other
things: amongst whom there was one, that brought barly to the Asse that
carried the goddesse, but the greedie whoresons thrust all into their
sacke, which they brought for the purpose and put it upon my backe, to
the end I might serve for two purposes, that is to say, for the barne
by reason of my corne, and for the Temple by reason of the goddesse. In
this sort, they went from place to place, robbing all the Countrey
over. At length they came to a certaine Castle where under colour of
divination, they brought to passe that they obtained a fat sheepe of a
poore husbandman for the goddesse supper and to make sacrifice withall.
After that the banket was prepared, they washed their bodies, and
brought in a tall young man of the village, to sup with them, who had
scarce tasted a few pottage, when hee began to discover their beastly
customes and inordinate desire of luxury. For they compassed him round
about, sitting at the table, and abused the young man, contrary to all
nature and reason. When I beheld this horrible fact, I could not but
attempt to utter my mind and say, O masters, but I could pronounce no
more but the first letter O, which I roared out so valiantly, that the
young men of the towne seeking for a straie Asse, that they had lost
the same night, and hearing my voice, whereby they judged that I had
beene theirs, entred into the house unwares, and found these persons
committing their vile abhomination, which when they saw, they declared
to all the inhabitants by, their unnatural villany, mocking and
laughing at this the pure and cleane chastity of their religion. In the
meane season, Phelibus and his company, (by reason of the bruit which
was dispersed throughout all the region there of their beastly
wickednesse) put all their trumpery upon my backe, and departed away
about midnight. When we had passed a great part of our journey, before
the rising of the Sun, we came into a wild desart, where they conspired
together to slay me. For after they had taken the goddesse from my
backe and set her gingerly upon the ground, they likewise tooke off my
harnesse, and bound me surely to an Oake, beating me with their whip,
in such sort that all my body was mortified. Amongst whom there was one
that threatened to cut off my legs with his hatchet, because by my
noyse I diffamed his chastity, but the other regarding more their owne
profit than my utility, thought best to spare my life, because I might
carry home the goddesse. So they laded me againe, driving me before
them with their naked swords, till they came to a noble City: where the
principall Patrone bearing high reverence unto the goddesse, Came in
great devotion before us with Tympany, Cymbals, and other instruments,
and received her, and all our company with much sacrifice and
veneration. But there I remember, I thought my selfe in most danger,
for there was one that brought to the Master of the house, a side of a
fat Bucke for a present, which being hanged behind the kitchin doore,
not far from the ground, was cleane eaten up by a gray hound, that came
in. The Cooke when he saw the Venison devoured, lamented and wept
pitifully. And because supper time approached nigh, when as he should
be reproved of too much negligence, he tooke a halter to hang himselfe:
but his wife perceiving whereabout he went, ran incontinently to him,
and taking the halter in both her hands, stopped him of his purpose,
saying, O husband, are you out of your writs? pray husband follow my
counsel, cary this strange Asse out into some secret place and kill
him, which done, cut off one of his sides, and sawce it well like the
side of the Bucke, and set it before your Master. Then the Cooke
hearing the counsell of his wife, was well pleased to slay me to save
himselfe: and so he went to the whetstone, to sharpe his tooles
accordingly.
THE NINTH BOOKE
THE THIRTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius saved himselfe from the Cooke, breaking his halter, and of
other things that happened.
In this manner the traiterous Cooke prepared himselfe to slay me: and
when he was ready with his knives to doe his feat, I devised with my
selfe how I might escape the present perill, and I did not long delay:
for incontinently I brake the halter wherewith I was tied, and flinging
my heeles hither and thither to save my selfe, at length I ran hastily
into a Parlour, where the Master of the house was feasting with the
Priests of the goddesse Syria, and disquieted all the company, throwing
downe their meats and drinks from the table. The Master of the house
dismayed at my great disorder, commanded one of his servants to take me
up, and locke me in some strong place, to the end I might disturb them
no more. But I little regarded my imprisonment, considering that I was
happily delivered from the hands of the traiterous Cooke. Howbeit
fortune, or the fatall disposition of the divine providence, which
neither can be avoided by wise counsell, neither yet by any wholesome
remedie, invented a new torment, for by and by a young ladde came
running into the Parlour all trembling, and declared to the Master of
the house, that there was a madde Dog running about in the streetes,
which had done much harme, for he had bitten many grey hounds and
horses in the Inne by: And he spared neither man nor beast. For there
was one Mitilius a Mulettour, Epheseus, a Cooke, Hyppanius a
chamberlaine, and Appolonius a Physition, who (thinking to chase away
the madde Dogge) were cruelly wounded by him, insomuch that many Horses
and other beasts infected with the venyme of his poysonous teeth became
madde likewise. Which thing caused them all at the table greatly to
feare, and thinking that I had beene bitten in like sort, came out with
speares, Clubs, and Pitchforks purposing to slay me, and I had
undoubtedly beene slaine, had I not by and by crept into the Chamber,
where my Master intended to lodge all night. Then they closed and
locked fast the doores about me, and kept the chamber round, till such
time as they thought that the pestilent rage of madnesse had killed me.
When I was thus shutte in the chamber alone, I laid me downe upon the
bed to sleepe, considering it was long time past, since I lay and tooke
my rest as a man doth. When morning was come, and that I was well
reposed, I rose up lustily. In the meane season, they which were
appointed to watch about the chamber all night, reasoned with
themselves in this sort, Verely (quoth one) I think that this rude Asse
be dead. So think I (quoth another) for the outragious poyson of
madness hath killed him, but being thus in divers opinions of a poore
Ass, they looked through a crevis, and espied me standing still, sober
and quiet in the middle of the chamber; then they opened the doores,
and came towards me, to prove whether I were gentle or no. Amongst whom
there was one, which in my opinion, was sent from Heaven to save my
life, that willed the other to set a bason of faire water before me,
and thereby they would know whether I were mad or no, for if I did
drinke without feare as I accustomed to do, it was a signe that I was
whole, and in mine Assie wits, where contrary if I did flie and abhorre
the tast of the water, it was evident proofe of my madness, which thing
he said that he had read in ancient and credible books, whereupon they
tooke a bason of cleere water, and presented it before me: but I as
soone as I perceived the wholesome water of my life, ran incontinently,
thrusting my head into the bason, drank as though I had beene greatly
athirst; then they stroked me with their hands, and bowed mine eares,
and tooke me by the halter, to prove my patience, but I taking each
thing in good part, disproved their mad presumption, by my meeke and
gentle behaviour: when I was thus delivered from this double danger,
the next day I was laded againe with the goddesse Siria, and other
trumpery, and was brought into the way with Trumpets and Cymbals to beg
in the villages which we passed by according to our custome. And after
that we had gone through a few towns and Castles, we fortuned to come
to a certaine village, which was builded (as the inhabitants there
affirme) upon the foundation of a famous ancient Citie. And after that
we had turned into the next Inne, we heard of a prettie jest committed
in the towne there, which I would that you should know likewise.
THE THIRTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER
Of the deceipt of a Woman which made her husband Cuckold.
There was a man dwelling in the towne very poore, that had nothing but
that which he got by the labour and travell of his hands: his wife was
a faire young woman, but very lascivious, and given to the appetite and
desire of the flesh. It fortuned on a day, that while this poore man
was gone betimes in the morning to the field about his businesse,
according as he accustomed to doe, his wives lover secretly came into
his house to have his pleasure with her. And so it chanced that during
the time that shee and he were basking together, her husband suspecting
no such matter, returned home praising the chast continency of his
wife, in that hee found his doores fast closed, wherefore as his
custome was, he whistled to declare his comming. Then his crafty wife
ready with shifts, caught her lover and covered him under a great tub
standing in a corner, and therewithall she opened the doore, blaming
her husband in this sort: Commest thou home every day with empty hands,
and bringest nothing to maintaine our house? thou hast no regard for
our profit, neither providest for any meate or drinke, whereas I poore
wretch doe nothing day and night but occupie my selfe with spinning,
and yet my travell will scarce find the Candels which we spend. O how
much more happy is my neighbour Daphne, that eateth and drinketh at her
pleasure and passeth the time with her amorous lovers according to her
desire. What is the matter (quoth her husband) though Our Master hath
made holiday at the fields, yet thinke not but I have made provision
for our supper; doest thou not see this tub that keepeth a place here
in our house in vaine, and doth us no service? Behold I have sold it to
a good fellow (that is here present) for five pence, wherefore I pray
thee lend me thy hand, that I may deliver him the tub. His wife (having
invented a present shift) laughed on her husband, saying: What marchant
I pray you have you brought home hither, to fetch away my tub for five
pence, for which I poore woman that sit all day alone in my house have
beene proffered so often seaven: her husband being well apayed of her
words demanded what he was that had bought the tub: Looke (quoth she)
he is gone under, to see where it be sound or no: then her lover which
was under the tub, began to stirre and rustle himselfe, and because his
words might agree to the words of the woman, he sayd: Dame will you
have me tell the truth, this tub is rotten and crackt as me seemeth on
every side. And then turning to her husband sayd: I pray you honest man
light a Candle, that I may make cleane the tub within, to see if it be
for my purpose or no, for I doe not mind to cast away my money
wilfully: he by and by (being made a very Oxe) lighted a candle,
saying, I pray you good brother put not your selfe to so much paine,
let me make the tub cleane and ready for you. Whereupon he put off his
coate, and crept under the tub to rub away the filth from the sides. In
the meane season this minion lover cast his wife on the bottome of the
tub and had his pleasure with her over his head, and as he was in the
middest of his pastime, hee turned his head on this side and that side,
finding fault with this and with that, till as they had both ended
their businesse, when as he delivered seaven pence for the tub, and
caused the good man himselfe to carry it on his backe againe to his
Inne.
THE THIRTY-NINTH CHAPTER
How the Priests of the goddesse Siria were taken and put in prison, and
how Apuleius was sold to a Baker.
After that we had tarried there a few dayes at the cost and charges of
the whole Village, and had gotten much mony by our divination and
prognostication of things to come: The priests of the goddesse Siria
invented a new meanes to picke mens purses, for they had certaine
lotts, whereon were written:
Coniuncti terram proscindunt boves ut in futurum loeta germinent sata
That is to say: The Oxen tied and yoked together, doe till the ground
to the intent it may bring forth his increase: and by these kind of
lottes they deceive many of the simple sort, for if one had demanded
whether he should have a good wife or no, they would say that his lot
did testifie the same, that he should be tyed and yoked to a good woman
and have increase of children. If one demanded whether he should buy
lands and possession, they said that he should have much ground that
should yeeld his increase. If one demanded whether he should have a
good and prosperous voyage, they said he should have good successe, and
it should be for the increase of his profit. If one demanded whether
hee should vanquish his enemies, and prevaile in pursuite of theeves,
they said that this enemy should be tyed and yoked to him: and his
pursuits after theeves should be prosperous. Thus by the telling of
fortunes, they gathered a great quantity of money, but when they were
weary with giving of answers, they drave me away before them next
night, through a lane which was more dangerous and stony then the way
which we went the night before, for on the one side were quagmires and
foggy marshes, on the other side were falling trenches and ditches,
whereby my legges failed me, in such sort that I could scarce come to
the plaine field pathes. And behold by and by a great company of
inhabitants of the towne armed with weapons and on horsebacke overtooke
us, and incontinently arresting Philebus and his Priests, tied them by
the necks and beate them cruelly, calling them theeves and robbers, and
after they had manacled their hands: Shew us (quoth they) the cup of
gold, which (under the colour of your solemne religion) ye have taken
away, and now ye thinke to escape in the night without punishment for
your fact. By and by one came towards me, and thrusting his hand into
the bosome of the goddesse Siria, brought out the cup which they had
stole. Howbeit for all they appeared evident and plaine they would not
be confounded nor abashed, but jesting and laughing out the matter, gan
say: Is it reason masters that you should thus rigorously intreat us,
and threaten for a small trifling cup, which the mother of the Goddesse
determined to give to her sister for a present? Howbeit for all their
lyes and cavellations, they were carryed backe unto the towne, and put
in prison by the Inhabitants, who taking the cup of gold, and the
goddesse which I bare, did put and consecrate them amongst the treasure
of the temple. The next day I was carryed to the market to be sold, and
my price was set at seaven pence more then Philebus gave for me. There
fortuned to passe by a Baker of the next village, who after that he had
bought a great deale of corne, bought me likewise to carry it home, and
when he had well laded me therewith, be drave me through a thorny and
dangerous way to his bake house; there I saw a great company of horses
that went in the mill day and night grinding of corne, but lest I
should be discouraged at the first, my master entertained me well, for
the first day I did nothing but fare daintily, howbeit such mine ease
and felicity did not long endure, for the next day following I was tyed
to the mill betimes in the morning with my face covered, to the end in
turning amid winding so often one way, I should not become giddy, but
keepe a certaine course, but although when I was a man I had seen many
such horsemills and knew well enough how they should be turned, yet
feining my selfe ignorant of such kind of toile, I stood still and
would not goe, whereby I thought I should be taken from the mill as an
Asse unapt, and put to some other light thing, or else to be driven
into the fields to pasture, but my subtility did me small good, for by
and by when the mill stood still, the servants came about me, crying
and beating me forward, in such sort that I could not stay to advise my
selfe, whereby all the company laughed to see so suddaine a change.
When a good part of the day was past, that I was not able to endure any
longer, they tooke off my harnesse, and tied me to the manger, but
although my bones were weary, and that I needed to refresh my selfe
with rest and provender, yet I was so curious that I did greatly
delight to behold the bakers art, insomuch that I could not eate nor
drinke while I looked on.
O good Lord what a sort of poore slaves were there; some had their
skinne blacke and blew, some had their backes striped with lashes, some
were covered with rugged sackes, some had their members onely hidden:
some wore such ragged clouts, that you might perceive all their naked
bodies, some were marked and burned in the heads with hot yrons, some
had their haire halfe clipped, some had lockes of their legges, some
very ugly and evill favoured, that they could scarce see, their eyes
and face were so blacke and dimme with smoake, like those that fight in
the sands, and know not where they strike by reason of dust: And some
had their faces all mealy. But how should I speake of the horses my
companions, how they being old and weake, thrust their heads into the
manger: they had their neckes all wounded and worne away: they rated
their nosethrilles with a continuall cough, their sides were bare with
their harnesse and great travell, their ribs were broken with beating,
their hooves were battered broad with incessant labour, and their
skinne rugged by reason of their lancknesse. When I saw this dreadfull
sight, I began to feare, least I should come to the like state: and
considering with my selfe the good fortune which I was sometime in when
I was a man, I greatly lamented, holding downe my head, and would eate
no meate, but I saw no comfort or consolation of my evill fortune,
saving that my mind was somewhat recreated to heare and understand what
every man said, for they neither feared nor doubted my presence. At
that time I remembred how Homer the divine author of ancient Poetry,
described him to be a wise man, which had travelled divers countries
and nations, wherefore I gave great thanks to my Asse for me, in that
by this meanes I had seene the experience of many things, and was
become more wise (notwithstanding the great misery and labour which I
daily sustained): but I will tell you a pretty jest, which commeth now
to my remembrance, to the intent your eares may be delighted in hearing
the same.
THE FORTIETH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was handled by the Bakers wife, which was a harlot.
The Baker which bought me was an honest and sober man; but his wife was
the most pestilent woman in all the world, insomuch that he endured
many miseries and afflictions with her, so that I my selfe did secretly
pitty his estate, and bewaile his evill fortune: for she had not one
fault alone, but all the mischiefes that could be devised: shee was
crabbed, cruell, lascivious, drunken, obstinate, niggish, covetous,
riotous in filthy expenses, and an enemy to faith and chastity, a
despise of all the Gods, whom other did honour, one that affirmed that
she had a God by her selfe, wherby she deceived all men, but especially
her poore husband, one that abandoned her body with continuall
whoredome. This mischievous queane hated me in such sort, that shee
commanded every day before she was up, that I should be put into the
mill to grind: and the first thing which she would doe in the morning,
was to see me cruelly beaten, and that I should grind when the other
beasts did feed and take rest. When I saw that I was so cruelly
handled, she gave me occasion to learne her conversation and life, for
I saw oftentimes a yong man which would privily goe into her chamber
whose face I did greatly desire to see, but I could not by reason mine
eyes were covered every day. And verily if I had beene free and at
liberty, I would have discovered all her abhomination. She had an old
woman, a bawd, a messenger of mischiefe that daily haunted to her
house, and made good cheere with her to the utter undoing and
impoverishment of her husband, but I that was greatly offended with the
negligence of Fotis, who made me an Asse, in stead of a Bird, did yet
comfort my selfe by this onely meane, in that to the miserable
deformity of my shape, I had long eares, whereby I might heare all
things that was done: On a day I heard the old bawd say to the Bakers
wife:
Dame you have chosen (without my counsell) a young man to your lover,
who as me seemeth, is dull, fearefull, without any grace, and
dastard-like coucheth at the frowning looke of your odious husband,
whereby you have no delight nor pleasure with him: how farre better is
the young man Philesiterus who is comely, beautifull, in the flower of
his youth, liberall, courteous, valiant and stout against the diligent
pries and watches of your husband, whereby to embrace the worthiest
dames of this country, and worthy to weare a crowne of gold, for one
part that he played to one that was jealous over his wife. Hearken how
it was and then judge the diversity of these two Lovers: Know you not
one Barbarus a Senator of our towne, whom the vulgar people call
likewise Scorpion for his severity of manners? This Barbarus had a
gentlewoman to his wife, whom he caused daily to be enclosed within his
house, with diligent custody. Then the Bakers wife said, I know her
very well, for we two dwelleth together in one house: Then you know
(quoth the old woman) the whole tale of Philesiterus? No verily (said
she) but I greatly desire to know it: therefore I pray you mother tell
me the whole story. By and by the old woman which knew well to babble,
began to tell as followeth.
THE FORTY-FIRST CHAPTER
How Barbarus being jealous over his wife, commanded that shee should be
kept close in his house, and what happened.
You shall understand that on a day this Barbarus preparing himselfe to
ride abroad, and willing to keepe the chastity of his wife (whom he so
well loved) alone to himselfe, called his man Myrmex (whose faith he
had tryed and proved in many things) and secretly committed to him the
custody of his wife, willing him that he should threaten, that if any
man did but touch her with his finger as he passed by, he would not
onely put him in prison, and bind him hand and foote, but also cause
him to be put to death, or else to be famished for lacke of sustenance,
which words he confirmed by an oath of all the Gods in heaven, and so
departed away: When Barbarus was gone, Myrmex being greatly astonied of
his masters threatnings, would not suffer his mistresse to goe abroad,
but as she sate all day a Spinning, he was so carefull that he sate by
her; when night came he went with her to the baines, holding her by the
garment, so faithfull he was to fulfill the commandement of his master:
Howbeit the beauty of this matron could not be hidden from the burning
eyes of Philesiterus, who considering her great chastity and how she
was diligently kept by Myrmex, thought it impossible to have his
purpose, yet (indeavouring by all kind of meanes to enterprise the
matter, and remembring the fragility of man, that might be intised and
corrupted with money, since as by gold the adamant gates may be opened)
on a day, when he found Myrmex alone, he discovered his love, desiring
him to shew his favour, (otherwise he should certainly dye) with
assurance that he need not to feare when as he might privily be let in
and out in the night, without knowledge of any person. When he thought,
with these and other gentle words to allure and prick forward the
obstinate mind of Myrmex he shewed him glittering gold in his hand,
saying that he would give his mistresse twenty crowns and him ten, but
Myrmex hearing these words, was greatly troubled, abhorring in his mind
to commit such a mischiefe: wherfore he stopped his eares, and turning
his head departed away: howbeit the glittering view of these crownes
could never be out of his mind, but being at home he seemed to see the
money before his eyes, which was so worthy a prey, wherefore poore
Myrmex being in divers opinions could not tell what to doe, for on the
one side he considered the promise which he made to his master, and the
punishment that should ensue if he did contrary. On the other side he
thought of the gaine, and the passing pleasure of the crownes of gold;
in the end the desire of the money did more prevaile then the feare of
death, for the beauty of the flowrishing crownes did so sticke in his
mind, that where the menaces of his master compelled him to tarry at
home, the pestilent avarice of gold egged him out a doores, wherefore
putting all shame aside, without further delay, he declared all the
whole matter to his Mistresse, who according to the nature of a woman,
when she heard him speake of so great a summe she bound chastity in a
string, and gave authority to Myrmex to rule her in that case. Myrmex
seeing the intent of his Mistresse, was very glad, and for great desire
of the gold, he ran hastily to Philesiterus, declaring that his
Mistresse was consented to his mind, wherefore he demanded the gold
which he promised. Then incontinently Philesiterus delivered him tenne
Crownes, and when night came, Myrmex brought him disguised into his
mistresses Chamber. About Midnight when he and she were naked together,
making sacrifice unto the Goddesse Venus, behold her husband (contrary
to their expectation) came and knocked at the doore, calling with a
loud voice to his Servant Myrmex: whose long tarrying increased the
suspition of his Master, in such sort that he threatned to beat Myrmex
cruelly: but he being troubled with feare, and driven to his latter
shifts, excused the matter saying: that he could not find the key: by
reason it was so darke. In the meane season Philesiterus hearing the
noise at the doore, slipt on his coat and privily ran out of the
Chamber. When Myrmex had opened the doore to his Master that threatned
terribly, and had let him in, he went into the Chamber to his wife: In
the mean while Myrmex let out Philesiterus, and barred the doores fast,
and went againe to bed. The next morning when Barbarus awaked, he
perceived two unknown slippers lying under his bed, which Philesiterus
had forgotten when he went away. Then he conceived a great suspition
and jealousie in mind, howbeit he would not discover it to his wife,
neither to any other person, but putting secretly the slippers into his
bosome, commanded his other Servants to bind Myrmex incontinently, and
to bring him bound to the Justice after him, thinking verily that by
the meane of the slippers he might boult out the matter. It fortuned
that while Barbarus went towards the Justice in a fury and rage, and
Myrmex fast bound, followed him weeping, not because he was accused
before his master, but by reason he knew his owne conscience guilty:
behold by adventure Philesiterus (going about earnest businesse)
fortuned to meet with them by the way, who fearing the matter which he
committed the night before, and doubting lest it should be knowne, did
suddainly invent a meane to excuse Myrmex, for he ran upon him and
beate him about the head with his fists, saying: Ah mischievous varlet
that thou art, and perjured knave. It were a good deed if the Goddesse
and thy master here, would put thee to death, for thou art worthy to be
imprisoned and to weare out these yrons, that stalest my slippers away
when thou werest at my baines yester night. Barbarus hearing this
returned incontinently home, and called his servant Myrmex, commanding
him to deliver the slippers againe to the right owner.
The old woman had scant finished her tale when the Bakers wife gan say:
Verily she is blessed and most blessed, that hath the fruition of so
worthy a lover, but as for me poore miser, I am fallen into the hands
of a coward, who is not onely afraid of my husband but also of every
clap of the mill, and dares not doe nothing, before the blind face of
yonder scabbed Asse. Then the old woman answered, I promise you
certainly if you will, you shall have this young man at your pleasure,
and therewithall when night came, she departed out of her chamber. In
the meane season, the Bakers wife made ready a supper with abundance of
wine and exquisite fare: so that there lacked nothing, but the comming
of the young man, for her husband supped at one of her neighbours
houses. When time came that my harnesse should be taken off and that I
should rest my selfe, I was not so joyfull of my liberty, as when the
vaile was taken from mine eyes, I should see all the abhomination of
this mischievous queane. When night was come and the Sunne gone downe,
behold the old bawd and the young man, who seemed to be but a child, by
reason he had no beard, came to the doore. Then the Bakers wife kissed
him a thousand times and received him courteously, placed him downe at
the table: but he had scarce eaten the first morsell, when the good man
(contrary to his wives expectation) returned home, for she thought he
would not have come so soone: but Lord how she cursed him, praying God
that he might breake his necke at the first entry in. In the meane
season, she caught her lover and thrust him into the bin where she
bolted her flower, and dissembling the matter, finely came to her
husband demanding why he came home so soone. I could not abide (quoth
he) to see so great a mischiefe and wicked fact, which my neighbours
wife committed, but I must run away: O harlot as she is, how hath she
dishonoured her husband, I sweare by the goddesse Ceres, that if I had
[not] seene it with mine eyes, I would never I have beleeved it. His
wife desirous to know the matter, desired him to tell what she had
done: then hee accorded to the request of his wife, and ignorant of the
estate of his own house, declared the mischance of another. You shall
understand (quoth he) that the wife of the Fuller my companion, who
seemed to me a wise and chast woman, regarding her own honesty and
profit of her house, was found this night with her knave. For while we
went to wash our hands, hee and she were together: who being troubled
with our presence ran into a corner, and she thrust him into a mow made
with twigs, appoynted to lay on clothes to make them white with the
smoake of fume and brymstone. Then she sate down with us at the table
to colour the matter: in the meane season the young man covered in the
mow, could not forbeare sneesing, by reason of the smoake of the
brymstone. The good man thinking it had beene his wife that sneesed,
cryed, Christ helpe. But when he sneesed more, he suspected the matter,
and willing to know who it was, rose from the table, and went to the
mow, where hee found a young man welnigh dead with smoke. When hee
understood the whole matter, he was so inflamed with anger that he
called for a sword to kill him, and undoubtedly he had killed him, had
I not restrained his violent hands from his purpose, assuring him, that
his enemy would dye with the force of his brimstone, without the harme
which he should doe. Howbeit my words would not appease his fury, but
as necessity required he tooke the young man well nigh choked, and
carried him out at the doores. In the meane season, I counsailed his
wife to absent her selfe at some of her Neighbours houses, till the
choller of her husband was pacified, lest he should be moved against
her, as he was against the young man. And so being weary of their
supper, I forthwith returned home. When the Baker had told his tale,
his impudent wife began to curse and abhorre the wife of the Fuller,
and generally all other wives, which abandon their bodies with any
other then with their owne Husbands, breaking the faith and bond of
marriage, whereby she said, they were worthy to be burned alive. But
knowing her owne guilty conscience and proper whoredome, lest her lover
should be hurt lying in the bin, she willed her husband to goe to bed,
but he having eaten nothing, said that he would sup before he went to
rest: whereby shee was compelled to maugre her eies, to set such things
on the Table as she had prepared for her lover.
But I, considering the great mischiefe of this wicked queane, devised
with my selfe how I might reveale the matter to my Master, and by
kicking away the cover of the binne (where like a Snaile the young-man
was couched) to make her whoredome apparent and knowne. At length I was
ayded by the providence of God, for there was an old man to whom the
custody of us was committed, that drave me poore Asse, and the other
Horses the same time to the water to drinke; then had I good occasion
ministred, to revenge the injury of my master, for as I passed by, I
perceived the fingers of the young-man upon the side of the binne, and
lifting up my heeles, I spurned off the flesh with the force of my
hoofes, whereby he was compelled to cry out, and to throw downe the
binne on the ground, and so the whoredome of the Bakers wife was knowne
and revealed. The Baker seeing this was not a little moved at the
dishonesty of his wife, but hee tooke the young-man trembling for feare
by the hand, and with cold and courteous words spake in this sort:
Feare not my Sonne, nor thinke that I am so barbarous or cruell a
person, that I would stiffle thee up with the smoke of Sulphur as our
neighbour accustometh, nor I will not punish thee according to the
rigour of the law of Julia, which commandeth the Adulterers should be
put to death: No no, I will not execute my cruelty against so faire and
comely a young man as you be, but we will devide our pleasure betweene
us, by lying all three in one bed, to the end there may be no debate
nor dissention betweene us, but that either of us may be contented, for
I have alwayes lived with my wife in such tranquillity, that according
to the saying of the wisemen, whatsoever I say, she holdeth for law,
and indeed equity will not suffer, but that the husband should beare
more authority then the wife: with these and like words he led the
young-man to his Chamber, and closed his wife in another Chamber. On
the next morrow, he called two of the most sturdiest Servants of his
house, who held up the young man, while he scourged his buttockes
welfavouredly with rods like a child. When he had well beaten him, he
said: Art not thou ashamed, thou that art so tender and delicate a
child, to desire the violation of honest marriages, and to defame thy
selfe with wicked living, whereby thou hast gotten the name of an
Adulterer? After he had spoken these and like words, he whipped him
againe, and chased him out of his house. The young-man who was the
comeliest of all the adulterers, ran away, and did nothing else that
night save onely bewaile his striped and painted buttockes. Soone after
the Baker sent one to his wife, who divorced her away in his name, but
she beside her owne naturall mischiefe, (offended at this great
contumely, though she had worthily deserved the same) had recourse to
wicked arts and trumpery, never ceasing untill she had found out an
Enchantresse, who (as it was thought) could doe what she would with her
Sorcery and conjuration. The Bakers wife began to intreate her,
promising that she would largely recompence her, if shee could bring
one of these things to passe, eyther to make that her husband may be
reconciled to her againe, or else if hee would not agree thereto, to
send an ill spirit into him, to dispossesse the spirit of her husband.
Then the witch with her abhominable science, began to conjure and to
make her Ceremonies, to turne the heart of the Baker to his wife, but
all was in vaine, wherefore considering on the one side that she could
not bring her purpose to passe, and on the other side the losse of her
gaine, she ran hastily to the Baker, threatning to send an evill spirit
to kill him, by meane of her conjurations. But peradventure some
scrupulous reader may demand me a question, how I, being an Asse, and
tyed alwayes in the mill house, could know the secrets of these women:
Verily I answer, notwithstanding my shape of an Asse, I had the sence
and knowledge of a man, and curiously endeavoured to know out such
injuries as were done to my master. About noone there came a woman into
the Milhouse, very sorrowfull, raggedly attired, with bare feete,
meigre, ill-favoured, and her hayre scattering upon her face: This
woman tooke the Baker by the hand, and faining that she had some secret
matter to tell him, went into a chamber, where they remained a good
space, till all the corne was ground, when as the servants were
compelled to call their master to give them more corne, but when they
had called very often, and no person gave answer, they began to
mistrust, insomuch that they brake open the doore: when they were come
in, they could not find the woman, but onely their master hanging dead
upon a rafter of the chamber, whereupon they cryed and lamented
greatly, and according to the custome, when they had washed themselves,
they tooke the body and buried it. The next day morrow, the daughter of
the Baker, which was married but a little before to one of the next
Village, came crying and beating her breast, not because she heard of
the death of her father by any man, but because his lamentable spirit,
with a halter about his necke appeared to her in the night, declaring
the whole circumstance of his death, and how by inchantment he was
descended into hell, which caused her to thinke that her father was
dead. After that she had lamented a good space, and was somewhat
comforted by the servants of the house, and when nine dayes were
expired, as inheretrix to her father, she sold away all the substance
of the house, whereby the goods chanced into divers mens hands.
THE FORTY-SECOND CHAPTER
How Apuleius after the Baker was hanged, was sold to a Gardener, and
what dreadfull things happened.
There was a poore Gardener amongst the rest, which bought me for the
summe of fifty pence, which seemed to him a great price, but he thought
to gayne it againe by the continuall travell of my body. The matter
requireth to tell likewise, how I was handled in his service. This
Gardener accustomed to drive me, every morning laded with hearbes to
the next Village, and when he had sold his hearbes, hee would mount
upon my backe and returne to the Garden, and while he digged the ground
and watered the hearbes, and went about other businesse, I did nothing
but repose my selfe with great ease, but when Winter approached with
sharpe haile, raine and frosts, and I standing under a hedge side, was
welnigh killed up with cold, and my master was so poore that he had no
lodging for himselfe, much lesse had he any littor or place to cover me
withall, for he himselfe alwayes lay under a little roofe shadowed with
boughes. In the morning when I arose, I found my hoofes shriveled
together with cold, and unable to passe upon the sharpe ice, and frosty
mire, neither could I fill my belly with meate, as I accustomed to doe,
for my master and I supped together, and had both one fare: howbeit it
was very slender since as wee had nothing else saving old and unsavoury
sallets which were suffered to grow for seed, like long broomes, and
that had lost all their sweet sappe and juice.
It fortuned on a day that an honest man of the next village was
benighted and constrained by reason of the rain to lodge (very lagged
and weary) in our Garden, where although he was but meanely received,
yet it served well enough considering time and necessity. This honest
man to recompence our entertainment, promised to give my master some
corne, oyle, and two bottels of wine: wherefore my master not delaying
the matter, laded me with sackes and bottels, and rode to the Towne
which was seaven miles off.
When we came to the honest mans house, he entertained and feasted my
master exceedingly. And it fortuned while they eate and dranke together
as signe of great amity there chanced a strange and dreadfull case: for
there was a Hen which ran kackling about the yard, as though she would
have layed an Egge. The good man of the house perceiving her, said: O
good and profitable pullet that feedest us every day with thy fruit,
thou seemest as though thou wouldest give us some pittance for our
dinner: Ho boy put the Pannier in the corner that the Hen may lay. Then
the boy did as his master commanded, but the Hen forsaking the Pannier,
came toward her master and laid at his feet not an Egge, which every
man knoweth, but a Chickin with feathers, clawes, and eyes, which
incontinently ran peeping after his damme. By and by happened a more
strange thing, which would cause any man to abhorre: under the Table
where they sate, the ground opened, and there appeared a great well and
fountain of bloud, insomuch that the drops thereof sparckled about the
Table. At the same time while they wondred at this dreadfull sight one
of the Servants came running out of the Seller, and told that all the
wine was boyled out of the vessels, as though there had beene some
great fire under. By and by a Weasel was scene that drew into the house
a dead Serpent, and out of the mouth of a Shepheards dog leaped a live
frog, and immediately after one brought word that a Ram had strangled
the same dog at one bit. All these things that happened, astonied the
good man of the house, and the residue that were present, insomuch that
they could not tell what to doe, or with what sacrifice to appease the
anger of the gods. While every man was thus stroken in feare, behold,
one brought word to the good man of the house, that his three sonnes
who had been brought up in good literature, and endued with good
manners were dead, for they three had great acquaintance and ancient
amity with a poore man which was their neighbour, and dwelled hard by
them: and next unto him dwelled another young man very rich both in
lands and goods, but bending from the race of his progenies
dissentions, and ruling himselfe in the towne according to his owne
will. This young royster did mortally hate this poore man, insomuch
that he would kill his sheepe, steale his oxen, and spoyle his corne
and other fruits before the time of ripenesse, yet was he not contented
with this, but he would encroch upon the poore mans ground, and clayme
all the heritage as his owne. The poore man which was very simple and
fearefull, seeing all his goods taken away by the avarice of the rich
man, called together and assembled many of his friends to shew them all
his land, to the end he might have but so much ground of his fathers
heritage, as might bury him. Amongst whom, he found these three
brethren, as friends to helpe and ayd him in his adversity and
tribulation.
Howbeit, the presence of these honest Citizens, could in no wise
perswade him to leave his extort power, no nor yet to cause any
temperance of his tongue, but the more they went about with gentle
words to tell him his faults, the more would he fret and likewise fume,
swearing all the oathes under God, that he little regarded the presence
of the whole City, whereupon incontinently he commanded his servants to
take the poore man by the eares, and carry him out of his ground, which
greatly offended all the standers by. Then one of the brethren spake
unto him somewhat boldly, saying: It is but a folly to have such
affiance in your riches, whereby you should use your tyranny against
the poore, when as the law is common for all men, and a redresse may be
had to suppresse your insolency. These words chafed him more then the
burning oile, or flaming brimstone, or scourge of whipps, saying: that
they should be hanged and their law too, before he would be subject
unto any person: and therewithall he called out his bandogges and great
masties, which accustomed to eate the carrion and carkases of dead
beasts in the fields, and to set upon such as passed by the way: then
he commanded they should be put upon all the assistance to teare them
in peeces: who as soone as they heard the hisse of their master, ran
fiercely upon them invading them on every side, insomuch that the more
they flied to escape away, the more cruell and terrible were the
dogges. It fortuned amongst all this fearefull company, that in
running, the youngest of the three brethren stombled at a stone, and
fell down to the ground: Then the dogs came upon him and tare him in
peeces with their teeth, whereby he was compelled to cry for succour:
His other two brethren hearing his lamentable voice ran towards him to
helpe him, casting their cloakes about their left armes, tooke up
stones to chase away the dogs, but all was in vaine, for they might see
their brother dismembred in every part of his body: Who lying at the
very point of death, desired his brethren to revenge his death against
that cruell tyrant: And therewithall he gave up the ghost. The other
two brethren perceiving so great a murther, and neglecting their owne
lives, like desperate persons dressed themselves against the tyrant,
and threw a great number of stones at him, but the bloudy theefe
exercised in such and like mischiefes, tooke a speare and thrust it
cleane through the body: howbeit he fell not downe to the ground. For
the speare that came out at his backe ran into the earth, and sustained
him up. By and by came one of these tyrants servants the most sturdiest
of the rest to helpe his master, who at the first comming tooke up a
stone and threw at the third brother, but by reason the stone ran along
his arme it did not hurt him, which chanced otherwise then all mens
expectation was: by and by the young man feigning that his arme was
greatly wounded, spake these words unto the cruell bloud sucker: Now
maist thou, thou wretch, triumph upon the destruction of all our
family, now hast thou fed thy insatiable cruelty with the bloud of
three brethren, now maist thou rejoyce at the fall of us Citizens, yet
thinke not but that how farre thou dost remove and extend the bounds of
thy land, thou shalt have some neighbor, but how greatly am I sorry in
that I have lost mine arme wherewithall I minded to cut off thy head.
When he had spoken these words, the furious theefe drew out his dagger,
and running upon the young man thought verily to have slaine him, but
it chanced otherwise: For the young man resisted him stoutly, and in
buckling together by violence wrested the dagger out of his hand: which
done, he killed the rich theefe with his owne weapon, and to the intent
the young man would escape the hands of the servants which came running
to assist their master, with the same dagger he cut his owne throat.
These things were signified by the strange and dreadfull wondres which
fortuned in the house of the good man, who after he had heard these
sorrowfull tydings could in no wise weepe, so farre was he stroken with
dolour, but presently taking his knife wherewith he cut his cheese and
other meate before, he cut his owne throat likewise, in such sort that
he fell upon the bord and imbraced the table with the streames of his
blond, in most miserable manner. Hereby was my master the Gardener
deprived of his hope, and paying for his dinner the watry teares of his
eyes, mounted upon my backe and so we went homeward the same way as wee
came.
THE FORTY-THIRD CHAPTER
How Apuleius was found by his shadow.
As wee passed by the way wee met with a tall souldier (for so his
habite and countenance declared) who with proud and arrogant words
spake to my master in this sort:
Quorsum vacuum ducis Asinum?
My master somewhat astonied at the strange sights which he saw before,
and ignorant of the Latine tongue, roade on and spake never a word: The
souldier unable to refraine his insolence, and offended at his silence,
strake him on the shoulders as he sate on my backe; then my master
gently made answer that he understood not what he said, whereat the
souldier angerly demanded againe, whither he roade with his Asse? Marry
(quoth he) to the next City: But I (quoth the souldier) have need of
his helpe, to carry the trusses of our Captaine from yonder Castle, and
therewithall he tooke me by the halter and would violently have taken
me away: but my master wiping away the blood of the blow which he
received of the souldier, desired him gently and civilly to take some
pitty upon him, and to let him depart with his owne, swearing and
affirming that his slow Asse, welnigh dead with sicknesse, could scarce
carry a few handfuls of hearbs to the next towne, much lesse he was
able to beare any greater trusses: but when he saw the souldier would
in no wise be intreated, but ready with his staffe to cleave my masters
head, my master fell down at his feete, under colour to move him to
some pitty, but when he saw his time, he tooke the souldier by the legs
and cast him upon the ground: Then he buffetted him, thumped him, bit
him, and tooke a stone and beat his face and his sides, that he could
not turne and defend himselfe, but onely threaten that if ever he rose,
he would choppe him in pieces. The Gardener when he heard him say so,
drew out his javelin which hee had by his side, and when he had throwne
it away, he knockt and beate him more cruelly then he did before,
insomuch that the souldier could not tell by what meanes to save
himselfe, but by feining that he was dead, Then my master tooke the
javelin and mounted upon my backe, riding in all hast to the next
village, having no regard to goe to his Garden, and when he came
thither, he turned into one of his friends house and declared all the
whole matter, desiring him to save his life and to hide himselfe and
his Asse in some secret place, untill such time as all danger were
past. Then his friends not forgetting the ancient amity betweene them,
entertained him willingly and drew me up a paire of staires into a
chamber, my master crept into a chest, and lay there with the cover
closed fast: The souldier (as I afterwards learned) rose up as one
awaked from a drunken sleepe, but he could scarce goe by reason of his
wounds: howbeit at length by little and little through ayd of his
staffe he came to the towne, but hee would not declare the matter to
any person nor complaine to any justice, lest he should be accused of
cowardise or dastardnesse, yet in the end he told some of his
companions of all the matter that happened: then they tooke him and
caused him to be closed in some secret place, thinking that beside the
injury which he had received, he should be accused of the breach of his
faith, by reason of the losse of his speare, and when they had learned
the signes of my master, they went to search him out: at last there was
an unfaithfull neighbour that told them where he was, then
incontinently the souldiers went to the Justice declaring that they had
lost by the way a silver goblet of their Captaines, and that a Gardener
had found it, who refusing to deliver the goblet, was hidden in one of
his friends houses: by and by the Magistrates understanding the losse
of the Captaine, came to the doores where we were, commanded our host
to deliver my master upon paine of death: howbeit these threatnings
could not enforce him to confesse that he was within his doores, but by
reason of his faithfull promise and for the safeguard of his friend, he
said, that hee saw not the Gardener a great while, neither knew where
he was: the souldiers said contrary, whereby to know the verity of the
matter, the Magistrates commanded their Seargants and ministers to
search every corner of the house, but when they could find neither
Gardener nor Asse, there was a great contention betweene the souldiers
and our Host, for they sayd we were within the house: and he said no,
but I that was very curious to know the matter, when I heard so great a
noyse, put my head out of the window to learne what the stirre and
tumult did signifie. It fortuned that one of the souldiers perceived my
shadow, whereupon he began to cry, saying: that hee had certainly seene
me; then they were all glad and came up into the chamber, and pulled me
downe like a prisoner. When they had found mee, they doubted nothing of
the Gardener, but seeking about more narrowly, at length they found him
couched in a chest. And so they brought out the poore gardener to the
Justices, who was committed immediately to prison, but they could never
forbeare laughing from the time they found me by my shadow, wherefore
is risen a common Proverbe: “The shadow of the Asse.”
THE TENTH BOOKE
THE FORTY-FOURTH CHAPTER
How the souldier drave Apuleius away, and how he came to a Captaines
house, and what happened there.
The next day how my master the Gardener sped, I knew not, but the
gentle souldier, who was well beaten for his cowardise, lead me to his
lodging without the contradiction of any man: Where hee laded me well,
and garnished my body (as seemed to me) like an Asse of armes. For on
the one side I bare an helmet that shined exceedingly: On the other
side a Target that glistered more a thousand folde. And on the top of
my burthen he put a long speare, which things he placed thus gallantly,
not because he was so expert in warre (for the Gardener proved the
contrary) but to the end he might feare those which passed by, when
they saw such a similitude of warre. When we had gone a good part of
our journey, over the plaine and easie fields, we fortuned to come to a
little towne, where we lodged at a certaine Captaines house. And there
the souldier tooke me to one of the servants, while he himselfe went
towards his captaine; who had the charge of a thousand men. And when we
had remained there a few dayes, I understood of a wicked and
mischievous fact committed there, which I have put in writing to the
end you may know the same. The master of the house had a sonne
instructed in good literature, and endued with vertuous manners, such a
one as you would desire to have the like. Long time before his mother
dyed, and when his father married a new wife, and had another child of
the age of xii. yeares. The stepdame was more excellent in beauty then
honesty: for she loved this young man her sonne in law, either because
she was unchast by nature, or because she was enforced by fate of
stepmother, to commit so great a mischiefe. Gentle reader, thou shalt
not read of a fable, but rather a tragedy: This woman when her love
began first to kindle in her heart, could easily resist her desire and
inordinate appetite by reason of shame and feare, lest her intent
should be knowne: But after it compassed and burned every part of her
brest, she was compelled to yeeld unto the raging flame of Cupid, and
under colour of the disease and infirmity of her body, to conceale the
wound of her restlesse mind. Every man knoweth well the signes and
tokens of love, and the malady convenient to the same: Her countenance
was pale, her eyes sorrowfull, her knees weake, and there was no
comfort in her, but continuall weeping and sobbing, insomuch that you
would have thought that she had some spice of an ague, saving that she
wept unmeasurably: the Phisitians knew not her disease, when they felt
the beating of her veines, the intemperance of her heart, the sobbing
sighes, and her often tossing of every side: No, no, the cunning
Phisitian knew it not, but a scholler of Venus Court might easily
conjecture the whole. After that she had beene long time tormented in
her affliction, and was no more able to conceale her ardent desire,
shee caused her sonne to be called for, (which word son she would faine
put away if it were not for shame:) Then he nothing disobedient to the
commandement of his mother, with a sad and modest countenance, came
into the chamber of his stepdame, the mother of his brother, but she
speaking never a word was in great doubt what she might doe, and could
not tell what to say first, by reason of shame. The young man
suspecting no ill, with humble courtesie demanded the cause of her
present disease. Then she having found an occasion to utter her intent,
with weeping eyes and covered face, began boldly to speake unto him in
this manner: Thou, thou, art the originall cause of all my dolour: Thou
art my comfort and onely health, for those thy comely eyes are so
enfastned within my brest, that unlesse they succour me, I shall
certainly die: Have pitty therefore upon me, be not the occasion of my
destruction, neither let my conscience reclaime to offend thy father,
when as thou shalt save the life of thy mother. Moreover since thou
dost resemble thy fathers shape in every point, it giveth me cause the
more to fancy thee: Now is ministred unto thee time and place: Now hast
thou occasion to worke thy will, seeing that we are alone. And it is a
common saying:
Never knowne, never done.
This young man troubled in mind at so suddaine an ill, although hee
abhorred to commit so beastly a crime, yet hee would not cast her off
with a present deniall, but warily pacified her mind with delay of
promise. Wherefore he promised to doe all according to her desire: And
in the meane season, he willed his mother to be of good cheere, and
comfort her selfe till as he might find some convenient time to come
unto her, when his father was ridden forth: Wherewithall hee got him
away from the pestilent sight of his stepdame. And knowing that this
matter touching the ruine of all the whole house needed the counsell of
wise and grave persons, he went incontinently to a sage old man and
declared the whole circumstance of the matter. The old man after long
deliberation, thought there was no better way to avoyd the storme of
cruell fortune to come, then to run away. In the meane season this
wicked woman impatient of her love, and the long delay of her sonne,
egged her husband to ride abroad into farre countreyes. And then she
asked the young-man the accomplishment of his promise, but he to rid
himselfe entirely from her hands, would find alwayes excuses, till in
the end she understood by the messengers that came in and out, that he
nothing regarded her. Then she by how much she loved him before, by so
much and more she hated him now. And by and by she called one of her
servants, ready to all mischiefes: To whom she declared all her
secrets. And there it was concluded betweene them two, that the surest
way was to kill the young man: Whereupon this varlet went incontinently
to buy poyson, which he mingled with wine, to the intent he would give
it to the young man to drinke, and thereby presently to kill him. But
while they were in deliberation how they might offer it unto him,
behold here happened a strange adventure. For the young sonne of the
woman that came from schoole at noone (being very thirsty) tooke the
pot wherein the poyson was mingled, and ignorant of the venim, dranke a
good draught thereof, which was prepared to kill his brother: whereby
he presently fell downe to the ground dead. His schoolemaster seeing
his suddaine change, called his mother, and all the servants of the
house with a lowd voyce. Incontinently every man declared his opinion,
touching the death of the child: but the cruell woman the onely example
of stepmothers malice, was nothing moved by the bitter death of her
sonne, or by her owne conscience of paracide, or by the misfortune of
her house, or by the dolour of her husband, but rather devised the
destruction of all her family. For by and by shee sent a messenger
after her husband to tell him the great misfortune which happened after
his departure. And when he came home, the wicked woman declared that
his sonne had empoysoned his brother, because he would not consent to
his will, and told him divers other leasings, adding in the end that
hee threatned to kill her likewise, because she discovered the fact:
Then the unhappy father was stroken with double dolour of the death of
his two children, for on the one side he saw his younger sonne slaine
before his eyes, on the other side, he seemed to see the elder
condemned to dye for his offence: Againe, where he beheld his wife
lament in such sort, it gave him further occasion to hate his sonne
more deadly; but the funerals of his younger sonne were scarce
finished, when the old man the father with weeping eyes even at the
returne from the grave, went to the Justice and accused his sonne of
the slaughter of his brother, and how he threatned to slay his wife,
whereby the rather at his weeping and lamentation, he moved all the
Magistrates and people to pitty, insomuch that without any delay, or
further inquisition they cryed all that hee should be stoned to death,
but the Justices fearing a farther inconvenience to arise by the
particular vengeance, and to the end there might fortune no sedition
amongst the people, prayed the decurions and other Officers of the
City, that they might proceed by examination of witnesses, and with
order of justice according to the ancient custome before the judging of
any hasty sentence or judgment, without the hearing of the contrary
part, like as the barbarous and cruell tyrants accustome to use:
otherwise they should give an ill example to their successours. This
opinion pleased every man, wherefore the Senatours and counsellors were
called, who being placed in order according to their dignity, caused
the accuser and defender to be brought forth, and by the example of the
Athenian law, and judgement materiall, their Advocates were commanded
to plead their causes briefly without preambles or motions of the
people to pitty, which were too long a processe. And if you demand how
I understood all this matter, you shall understand that I heard many
declare the same, but to recite what words the accuser used in his
invective, what answer the defender made, the orations and pleadings of
each party, verily I am not able to doe: for I was fast bound at the
manger. But as I learned and knew by others, I will God willing declare
unto you. So it was ordered, that after the pleadings of both sides was
ended, they thought best to try and boult out the verity by witnesses,
all presumptions and likelihood set apart, and to call in the servant,
who onely was reported to know all the matter: by and by the servant
came in, who nothing abashed, at the feare of so great a judgment, or
at the presence of the Judges, or at his owne guilty conscience, which
hee so finely fained, but with a bold countenance presented himselfe
before the justices and confirmed the accusation against the young man,
saying: O yee judges, on a day when this young man loathed and hated
his stepmother, hee called mee, desiring mee to poyson his brother,
whereby hee might revenge himselfe, and if I would doe it and keepe the
matter secret, hee promised to give me a good reward for my paines: but
when the young man perceived that I would not accord to his will, he
threatned to slay mee, whereupon hee went himselfe and bought poyson,
and after tempered it with wine, and then gave it me to give the child,
which when I refused he offered it to his brother with his own hands.
When the varlet with a trembling countenance had ended these words
which seemed a likelihood of truth, the judgement was ended: neither
was there found any judge or counsellor, so mercifull to the young man
accused, as would not judge him culpable, but that he should be put and
sowne in a skin, with a dogge, a Cocke, a Snake, and an Ape, according
to the law against parricides: wherefore they wanted nothing but (as
the ancient custome was) to put white stones and black into a pot, and
to take them out againe, to see whether the young-man accused should be
acquitted by judgment or condemned, which was a thing irrevocable.
In the mean season he was delivered to the hands of the executioner.
But there arose a sage and ancient Physitian, a man of a good
conscience and credit throughout all the City, that stopped the mouth
of the pot wherein the stones were cast, saying: I am right glad ye
reverend judges, that I am a man of name and estimation amongst you,
whereby I am accompted such a one as will not suffer any person to be
put to death by false and untrue accusations, considering there hath
bin no homicide or murther committed by this yong man in this case,
neither you (being sworn to judge uprightly) to be misinformed and
abused by invented lyes and tales. For I cannot but declare and open my
conscience, least I should be found to beare small honour and faith to
the Gods, wherefore I pray you give eare, and I will shew you the whole
truth of the matter. You shall understand that this servant which hath
merited to be hanged, came one of these dayes to speake with me,
promising to give me a hundred crownes, if I would give him present
poyson, which would cause a man to dye suddenly, saying, that he would
have it for one that was sicke of an incurable disease, to the end he
might be delivered from all torment, but I smelling his crafty and
subtill fetch, and fearing least he would worke some mischiefe withall,
gave him a drinke; but to the intent I might cleare my selfe from all
danger that might happen, I would not presently take the money which he
offered. But least any of the crownes should lacke weight or be found
counterfeit, I willed him to scale the purse wherein they were put,
with his manuell signe, whereby the next day we might goe together to
the Goldsmith to try them, which he did; wherefore understanding that
he was brought present before you this day, I hastily commanded one of
my servants to fetch the purse which he had sealed, and here I bring it
unto you to see whether he will deny his owne signe or no: and you may
easily conject that his words are untrue, which he alleadged against
the young man, touching the buying of the poyson, considering hee
bought the poyson himselfe. When the Physitian had spoken these words
you might perceive how the trayterous knave changed his colour, how hee
sweat for feare, how he trembled in every part of his body: and how he
set one leg upon another, scratching Ibis head and grinding his teeth,
whereby there was no person but would judge him culpable. In the end,
when he was somewhat returned to his former subtility, he began to deny
all that was said, and stoutly affirmed, that the Physitian did lye.
But the Physitian perceiving that he was rayled at and his words
denyed, did never cease to confirme his sayings, and to disprove the
varlet, till such time as the Officers by the commandment of the
Judges, bound his hands and brought out the seale, wherewith he had
sealed the purse which augmented suspition which was conceived of him
first. Howbeit, neither the feare of the wheele or any other torment
according to the use of the Grecians, which were ready prepared, no,
nor yet the fire could enforce him to confesse the matter, so obstinate
and grounded was he in his mischievous mind. But the Physitian
perceiving that the menaces of these torments did nothing prevaile, gan
say: I cannot suffer or abide that this young man who is innocent,
should against all law and conscience, be punished and condemned to
die, and the other which is culpable, should escape so easily, and
after mocke and flowte at your judgement: for I will give you an
evident proofe and argument of this present crime. You shall
understand, that when this caytiffe demanded of me a present and strong
poyson, considering that it was not my part to give occasion of any
others death, but rather to cure and save sicke persons by meane of
medicines: and on the other side, fearing least if I should deny his
request, I might minister a further cause of his mischiefe, either that
he would buy poyson of some other, or else returne and worke his wicked
intent, with a sword or some dangerous weapon, I gave him no poyson,
but a doling drinke of Mandragora, which is of such force, that it will
cause any man to sleepe as though he were dead. Neither is it any
marvaile if this most desperate man, who is certainly assured to be put
to death, ordained by an ancient custome, can suffer and abide these
facill and easie torments, but if it be so that the child hath received
the drinke as I tempered it with mine owne hands, he is yet alive and
doth but sleepe, and after his sleepe he shall returne to life againe,
but if he be dead indeed, then may you further enquire of the causes of
his death. The opinion of this ancient Physitian was found good, and
every man had a desire to goe to the Sepulchre where the child was
layd; there was none of the Justices, none of any reputation of the
towne, nor any of the common people, but went to see this strange
sight. Amongst them all the father of the child remooved with his owne
hands the stone of the Sepulchre, and found his Sonne rising up after
his dead and soporiferous sleepe, whom when he beheld, he imbraced him
in his armes, and presented him before the people, with great joy and
consolation, and as he was wrapped and bound in his grave, so he
brought him before the Judges, whereupon the wickednesse of the
Servant, and, the treason of the stepdame was plainely discovered, and
the verity of the matter revealed, whereby the woman was perpetually
exiled, the Servant hanged on a Gallowes, and the Physitian had the
Crownes, which was prepared to buy the poyson. Behold how the fortune
of the old man was changed, who thinking to be deprived of all his race
and posterity, was in one moment made the Father of two Children. But
as for me, I was ruled and handled by fortune, according to her
pleasure.
THE FORTY-FIFTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius was sold to two brethren, whereof one was a Baker, and the
other a Cooke, and how finely and daintily he fared.
THE Souldier that payed never a peny for me, by the commandement of his
Captaine was sent unto Rome, to cary Letters to the great Prince, and
Generall of the Campe. Before he went, he sold me for eleven pence to
two of his Companions, being Servants to a man of worship, whereof one
was a Baker that baked sweet bread and delicates, the other a Cooke,
which dressed fine and excellent meats for his Master. These two lived
in common, and would drive me from place to place, to carry such things
as was necessary, insomuch that I was received by these two, as a third
Brother, and Companion, and I thought I was never better placed, then
with them: for when night came that Supper was done, and their
businesse ended, they would bring many good morsels into their Chamber
for themselves. One would bring Pigs, Chickens, fish, and other good
meates, the other fine bread, pasties, tarts, custards and other
delicate Junkets dipped in hony. And when they had shut their chamber
doore, and went to the bains: (O Lord) how I would fill my guts with
these goodly dishes: neither was I so much a foole, or so very an Asse,
to leave the dainty meats, and to grind my teeth upon hard hay. In this
sort I continued a great space, for I played the honest Asse, taking
but a little of one dish, and a little of another, wherby no man
distrusted me. In the end, I was more hardier and began to devoure the
whole messes of the sweet delicates, which caused the Baker and the
Cooke to suspect, howbeit they nothing mistrusted me, but searched
about to apprehend the theefe. At length they began to accuse one
another of theft, and to set the dishes and morsels of meat in order,
one by another, because they would learne what was taken away, whereby
one of them was compelled to say thus to his fellow: Is it reason to
breake promise and faith in this sort, by stealing away the best meat,
and to sell it to augment thy good, and yet neverthelesse to have thy
part in the residue that is left: if our partnership doe mislike thee,
we will be partners and brothers in other things, but in this we will
breake of: for I perceive that the great losse which I sustain, will at
length be a cause of great discord betweene us. Then answered the
other, Verily I praise thy great constancy and subtilnesse, in that
(when thou hast secretly taken away the meat) [thou] dost begin to
complaine first, whereas I by long space of time have suffered thee,
because I would not seeme to accuse my brother of theft, but I am right
glad in that wee are fallen into communication of the matter, least by
our silence, like contention might arise betweene us, as fortuned
betweene Eteocles and his Brother. When they had reasoned together in
this sort, they swore both earnestly, that neither of them stale or
tooke away any jote of the meate, wherefore they concluded to search
out the Theefe by all kind of meanes. For they could not imagin or
thinke, the Asse who stood alone there, would eate any such meates,
neither could they thinke that Mice or Flyes, were so ravenous, as to
devouer whole dishes of meat, like the Birds Harpies which carried away
the meates of Phineus the King of Archadia. In the Meane season while I
was fed with dainty morsels, I gathered together my flesh, my skin
waxed soft, my haire began to shine, and was gallant on every part, but
such faire and comely shape of my body, was cause of my dishonour, for
the Baker and Cooke marvelled to see me so slick and fine, considering
I did eate no hay at all. Wherefore on a time at their accustomed
houre, they went to the baines, and locked their chamber doore. It
fortuned that ere they departed away, they espyed me through a hole,
how I fell roundly to my victuals: then they marvelled greatly, and
little esteemed the losse of their meate, laughed exceedingly, calling
the servants of the house, to shew them the greedy gorge and appetite
of the Asse. Their laughing was so immoderate that the master of the
house heard them, and demanded the cause of their laughter, and when
hee understood all the matter, hee looked through the hole likewise,
wherewith he took such a delectation that hee commanded the doore to be
opened, that hee might see mee at his pleasure. Then I perceiving every
man laugh, was nothing abashed, but rather more bold, whereby I never
rested eating, till such time as the master of the house commanded me
to be brought into his parler as a novelty, and there caused all kinds
of meates which were never touched to be set on the table, which
(although I had eaten sufficiently before, yet to win the further
favour of the master of the house) I did greedily devoure and made a
cleane riddance of all the delicate meates. And to prove my nature
wholly, they gave mee such meates as every Asse doth abhorre: for they
put before mee beefe and vinegar, birds and pepper, fish and verjuice:
in the meane season they that beheld mee at the table did nothing but
laugh. Then one of the servants of the house sayd to his master, I pray
you sir give him some drinke to his supper: Marry (quoth hee) I thinke
thou saist true, for it may be, that to his meate hee would drinke
likewise a cup of wine. Hoe boy, wash yonder pot, and fill it with
wine, which done, carry it to the Asse, and say that I have drunke to
him. Then all the standers by looked on, to see what would come to
passe: but I (as soone as I beheld the cup) staied not long, but
gathering my lips together, supped up all the wine at one draught. The
master being right joyfull hereat caused the Baker and Cooke which had
bought me, to come before him, to whom he delivered foure times as much
for me, as they paid, which done he committed me to one of his rich
Libertines, and charged him to looke well to me, and that I should
lacke nothing, who obeied his masters commandement in every point: and
to the end he would creepe further into his favour, he taught me a
thousand qualities. First he instructed me to sit at the table upon my
taile, and how I should leape and dance, holding up my former feete:
moreover hee taught me how I should answer when any body spake unto me,
with nodding my head, which was a strange and marvailous thing, and if
I did lacke drinke, I should looke still upon the pot. All which things
I did willingly bring to passe, and obeyed his doctrine: howbeit, I
could have done all these things without his teaching, but I feared
greatly lest in shewing my selfe cunning without a master, I should
pretend some great and strange wonder, and thereby be throwne out to
wild beasts. But my fame was spred about in every place, and the
qualities which I could doe, insomuch that my master was renowned
throughout all the Country by reason of mee. For every man would say:
Behold the Gentleman that hath an Asse, that will eate and drinke with
him, that will dance, and understand what is said to him, will shew his
fantasie by signes. But first I will tell you (which I should have done
before) who my master was, and of what country. His name was Thiasus,
hee was borne at Corinth, which is a principall towne of Achaia, and he
had passed many offices of honor, till hee had taken upon him the
degree Quinquenuall, according as his birth and dignity required, who
to shew his worthinesse, and to purchase the benevolence of every
person, appointed publike joyes and triumphs, to endure the space of
three dayes, and to bring his endeavour to passe, he came into Thessaly
to buy excellent Beasts, and valiant fighters for the purpose.
THE FORTY-SIXTH CHAPTER
How a certaine Matron fell in love with Apuleius, how hee had his
pleasure with her, and what other things happened.
When he had bought such things as was necessary, he would not returne
home into his Countrey in Chariots, or waggon, neither would he ride
upon Thessalian Horses, or Jenets of France, or Spanish Mules, which be
most excellent as can be found, but caused me to be garnished and
trimmed with trappers and barbs of Gold, with brave harnesse, with
purple coverings, with a bridle of silver, with pictured cloths, and
with shrilling bells, and in this manner he rode upon me lovingly,
speaking and intreating me with gentle words, but above all things he
did greatly rejoyce in that I was his Servant to beare him upon my
backe, and his Companion to feed with him at the Table: After long time
when we had travelled as well by Sea as Land, and fortuned to arrive at
Corinth, the people of the Towne came about us on every side, not so
much to doe honour to Thiasus, as to see me: For my fame was so greatly
spread there, that I gained my master much money, and when the people
was desirous to see me play prankes, they caused the Gates to be shut,
and such as entered in should pay money, by meanes whereof I was a
profitable companion to them every day: There fortuned to be amongst
the Assembly a noble and rich Matron that conceived much delight to
behold me, and could find no remedy to her passions and disordinate
appetite, but continually desired to have her pleasure with me, as
Pasiphae had with a Bull. In the end she promised a great reward to my
keeper for the custody of me one night, who for gaine of a little money
accorded to her desire, and when I had supped in a Parler with my
Master, we departed away and went into our Chamber, where we found the
faire Matron, who had tarried a great space for our comming: I am not
able to recite unto you how all things were prepared: there were foure
Eunuches that lay on a bed of downe on the ground with Boulsters
accordingly for us to lye on, the Coverlet was of cloth of Gold, and
the pillowes soft and tender, whereon the delicate Matron had
accustomed to lay her head. Then the Eunuches not minding to delay any
longer the pleasure of their Mistresse closed the doores of the Chamber
and departed away: within the Chamber were Lamps that gave a cleare
light all the place over: Then she put off all her Garments to her
naked skinne, and taking the Lampe that stood next to her, began to
annoint all her body with balme, and mine likewise, but especially my
nose, which done, she kissed me, not as they accustome to doe at the
stews, or in brothel houses, or in the Curtain Schools for gaine of
money, but purely, sincerely, and with great affection, casting out
these and like loving words: Thou art he whom I love, thou art he whom
I onely desire, without thee I cannot live, and other like preamble of
talke as women can use well enough, when as they mind to shew or
declare their burning passions and great affection of love: Then she
tooke me by the halter and cast me downe upon the bed, which was
nothing strange unto me, considering that she was so beautifull a
Matron and I so wel bolded out with wine, and perfumed with balme,
whereby I was readily prepared for the purpose: But nothing grieved me
so much as to think, how I should with my huge and great legs imbrace
so faire a Matron, or how I should touch her fine, dainty, and silken
skinne, with my hard hoofes, or how it was possible to kisse her soft,
pretty and ruddy lips, with my monstrous mouth and stony teeth, or how
she, who was young and tender, could be able to receive me.
And I verily thought, if I should hurt the woman by any kind of meane,
I should be throwne to the wild Beasts: But in the meane season she
kissed me, and looked in my mouth with burning eyes, saying: I hold
thee my canny, I hold thee my noose, my sparrow, and therewithall she
eftsoones imbraced my body round about, and had her pleasure with me,
whereby I thought the mother of Miniatures did not ceaseless quench her
inordinate desire with a Bull. When night was passed, with much joy and
small sleepe, the Matron went before day to my keeper to bargain with
him another night, which he willingly granted, partly for gaine of
money, and partly to finde new pastime for my master. Who after he was
informed of all the history of my luxury, was right glad, and rewarded
my keeper well for his paine, minding to shew before the face of all
the people, what I could doe: but because they would not suffer the
Matron to abide such shame, by reason of her dignity, and because they
could finde no other that would endeavour so great a reproach, at
length they obtained for money a poore woman, which was condemned to be
eaten of wilde beasts, with whom I should openly have to doe: But first
I will tell you what tale I heard concerning this woman. This woman had
a husband, whose father minding to ride forth, commanded his wife which
he left at home great with child, that if she were delivered of a
daughter, it should incontinently be killed. When the time of her
delivery came, it fortuned that she had a daughter, whom she would not
suffer to be slaine, by reason of the naturall affection which she have
unto her child, but secretly committed her to one of her neighbours to
nurse. And when her husband returned home, shee declared unto him that
shee was delivered of a daughter, whom (as hee commanded), shee had
caused to be put to death. But when this child came to age, and ready
to be married, the mother knew not by what meanes shee should endow her
daughter, but that her husband should understand and perceive it.
Wherefore shee discovered the matter to her sonne, who was the husband
of this woman, condemned to be eaten of wild beasts: For shee greatly
feared least hee should unawares fancie or fall in love with his owne
sister. The young man understanding the whole matter (to please and
gratify his mother) went immediately to the young maiden, keeping the
matter secret in his heart, for feare of inconvenience, and (lamenting
to see his sister forsaken both of mother and father) incontinently
after endowed her with part of his owne goods, and would have married
her to one of his especial and trusty friends: But although hee brought
this to passe very secretly and sagely, yet in the end cruell fortune
sowed great sedition in his house. For his wife who was now condemned
to beasts, waxed jealous of her husband and began to suspect the young
woman as a harlot and common queane, insomuch that shee invented all
manner of meanes to dispatch her out of the way. And in the end shee
invented this kind of mischiefe: She privily stale away her husbands
ring, and went into the country, whereas she commanded one of her
trusty servants to take the ring and carry it to the mayden. To whom he
should declare that her brother did pray her to come into the country
to him, and that she should come alone without any person. And to the
end shee should not delay but come with all speed he should deliver her
the ring, which should be a sufficient testimony of the message. This
mayden as soone as she had received the ring of her brother, being very
willing and desirous to obey his commandement: (For she knew no
otherwise but that he had sent for her) went in all hast as the
messenger willed her to doe. But when she was come to the snare and
engine which was prepared for her, the mischievous woman, like one that
were mad, and possessed with some ill spirit, when the poore maiden
called for helpe with a loud voyce to her brother, the wicked harlot
(weening that she had invented and feined the matter) tooke a burning
firebrand and thrust it into her secret place, whereby she died
miserably. The husband of this maiden but especially her brother,
advertised of her death, came to the place where she was slain, and
after great lamentation and weeping, they caused her to be buried
honourably. This yong man her brother taking in ill part the miserable
death of his sister, as it was convenient he should, conceived so great
dolour within his mind and was strucken with so pestilent fury of
bitter anguish, that he fell into the burning passions of a dangerous
ague, whereby he seemed in such necessity, that he needed to have some
speedy remedy to save his life. The woman that slew the Maiden having
lost the name of wife together with her faith, went to a traiterous
Physician, who had killed a great many persons in his dayes and
promised him fifty peeces of Gold, if he would give her a present
poyson to kill her husband out of hand, but in presence of her Husband,
she feined that it was necessary for him to receive a certaine kind of
drink, which the Maisters and Doctours of Physicke doe call a sacred
Potion, to the intent he might purge Choller and scoure the interiour
parts of his body. But the Physitian in stead of that drinke prepared a
mortall and deadly poyson, and when he had tempered it accordingly, he
tooke the pot in the presence of the family, and other neighbours and
friends of the sick yong man, and offered it to his patient. But the
bold and hardy woman, to the end she might accomplish her wicked
intent, and also gaine the money which she had promised the Physitian,
staid the pot with her hand, saying: I pray you master Physitian,
minister not this drinke unto my deare Husband, untill such time as you
have drunke some part thereof your selfe: For what know I, whether you
have mingled any poyson in the drinke or no, wherein I would have you
not to be offended: For I know that you are a man of wisedome and
learning, but this I do to the intent the conscience and love that I
beare to the health and safeguard of my husband, may be apparent. The
Physitian being greatly troubled at the wickednesse of this mischievous
woman, as voyd of all counsell and leysure to consider of the matter,
and least he might give any cause of suspition to the standers by, or
shew any scruple of his guilty conscience, by reason of long delay,
tooke the pot in his hand, and presently drunke a good draught thereof,
which done, the young man having no mistrust, drunke up the residue.
The Physitian would have gone immediately home to receive a
counterpoyson, to expell and drive out the first poyson: But the wicked
woman persevering in her mischiefe, would not suffer him to depart a
foot, untill such time as the poyson began to worke in him, and then by
much prayer and intercession she licensed him to goe home: By the way
the poyson invaded the intrailes and bowels of the whole body of the
Physitian, in such sort that with great paine he came to his owne
house, where he had scarce time to speake to his wife, and to will her
to receive the promised salitary of the death of two persons, but he
yeelded up the ghost: And the other young man lived not long after, but
likewise dyed, amongst the feined and deceitfull teares of his cursed
wife. A few dayes after, when the young man was buried and the funerall
ended, the Physitians wife demanded of her the fifty peeces of gold
which she promised her husband for the drinke, whereat the ill disposed
woman, with resemblance of honesty, answered her with gentle words, and
promised to give her the fifty peeces of gold, if she would fetch her a
little of that same drinke, to proceed and make an end of all her
enterprise. The Physitians wife partly to winne the further favour of
this rich woman, and partly to gaine the money, ranne incontinently
home, and brought her a whole roote of poyson, which when she saw,
having now occasion to execute her further malice, and to finish the
damnable plot, began to stretch out her bloody hands to murther. She
had a daughter by her husband (that was poysoned) who according to
order of law, was appointed heire of all the lands and goods of her
father: but this woman knowing that the mothers succoured their
children, and received all their goods after their death, purposed to
shew her selfe a like parent to her child, as she was a wife to her
husband, whereupon she prepared a dinner with her owne hands, and
empoysoned both the wife of the Physitian and her owne daughter: The
child being young and tender dyed incontinently by force of the drinke,
but the Physitians wife being stout and strong of complexion, feeling
the poison to trill down into her body, doubted the matter, and
thereupon knowing of certainty that she had received her bane, ran
forthwith to the judges house, that what with her cryes, and
exclamations, she raised up the people of the towne, and promising them
to shew divers wicked and mischievous acts, caused that the doores and
gates were opened. When she came in she declared from the beginning to
the end the abhomination of this woman: but shee had scarce ended her
tale, when opening her falling lips, and grinding her teeth together,
she fell downe dead before the face of the Judge, who incontinently to
try the truth of the matter, caused the cursed woman, and her servants
to be pulled out of the house, and enforced by paine of torment to
confesse the verity, which being knowne, this mischievous woman farre
lesse then she deserved, but because there could be no more cruell a
death invented for the quality of her offence, was condemned to be
eaten with wild beasts. Behold with this woman was I appointed to have
to doe before the face of the people, but I being wrapped in great
anguish, and envying the day of the triumph, when we two should so
abandon our selves together, devised rather to sley my selfe, then to
pollute my body with this mischievous harlot, and so for ever to
remaine defamed: but it was impossible for me so to doe, considering
that I lacked hands, and was not able to hold a knife in my hoofes:
howbeit standing in a pretty cabin, I rejoyced in my selfe to see that
spring time was come, and that all things flourished, and that I was in
good hope to find some Roses, to render me my humane shape. When the
day of triumph came, I was led with great pompe and benevolence to the
appointed place, where when I was brought, I first saw the preamble of
that triumph, dedicated with dancers and merry taunting jests, and in
the meane season was placed before the gate of the Theater, whereas on
the one side I saw the greene and fresh grasse growing before the entry
thereof, whereon I greatly desired to feed: on the other side I
conceived a great delectation to see when the Theater gates were
opened, how all things was finely prepared and set forth: For there I
might see young children and maidens in the flowre of their youth of
excellent beauty, and attired gorgiously, dancing and mooved in comely
order, according to the order of Grecia, for sometime they would dance
in length, sometime round together, sometime divide themselves into
foure parts, and sometime loose hands on every side: but when the
trumpet gave warning that every man should retire to his place, then
began the triumph to appeare. First there was a hill of wood, not much
unlike that which the Poet Homer called Idea, for it was garnished
about with all sort of greene verdures and lively trees, from the top
whereof ran downe a cleare and fresh fountaine, nourishing the waters
below, about which wood were many young and tender Goates, plucking and
feeding daintily on the budding trees, then came a young man a
shepheard representing Paris, richly arrayed with vestments of Barbary,
having a mitre of gold upon his head, and seeming as though he kept the
goates. After him ensued another young man all naked, saving that his
left shoulder was covered with a rich cloake, and his head shining with
glistering haires, and hanging downe, through which you might perceive
two little wings, whereby you might conjecture that he was Mercury,
with his rod called Caduceus, he bare in his right hand an Apple of
gold, and with a seemely gate went towards him that represented Paris,
and after hee had delivered him the Apple, he made a signe, signifying
that Jupiter had commanded him so to doe: when he had done his message
he departed away. And by and by, there approached a faire and comely
mayden, not much unlike to Juno, for she had a Diademe of gold upon her
head, and in her hand she bare a regall scepter: then followed another
resembling Pallas, for she had on her head a shining sallet, whereon
was bound a garland of Olive branches, having in one hand a target or
shield: and in the other a speare as though she would fight: then came
another which passed the other in beauty, and presented the Goddesse
Venus, with the color of Ambrosia, when she was a maiden, and to the
end she would shew her perfect beauty, shee appeared all naked, saving
that her fine and dainty skin was covered with a thin smocke, which the
wind blew hither and thither to testifie the youth and flowre of the
age of the dame. Her colour was of two sorts, for her body was white as
descended from heaven, and her smocke was blewish, as arrived from the
sea: After every one of the Virgins which seemed goddesses, followed
certaine waiting servants, Castor and Pollus went behind Juno, having
on their heads helmets covered with starres. This Virgin Juno sounded a
Flute, which shee bare in her hand, and mooved her selfe towards the
shepheard Paris, shewing by honest signes and tokens, and promising
that hee should be Lord of all Asia, if hee would judge her the fairest
of the three, and to give her the apple of gold: the other maiden which
seemed by her armour to be Pallas, was accompanied with two young men
armed, and brandishing their naked swords in their hands, whereof one
named Terror, and the other Feare; behind them approached one sounding
his trumpet to provoke and stirre men to battell; this maiden began to
dance and shake her head, throwing her fierce and terrible eyes upon
Paris and promising that if it pleased him to give her the victory of
beauty, shee would make him the most strong and victorious man alive.
Then came Venus and presented her selfe in the middle of the Theater,
with much favour of all the people, for shee was accompanied with a
great many of youth, whereby you would have judged them all to be
Cupidoes, either to have flowne from heaven or else from the river of
the sea, for they had wings, arrowes, and the residue of their habit
according in each point, and they bare in their hands torches lighted,
as though it had beene a day of marriage. Then came in a great
multitude of faire maidens: on the one side were the most comely
Graces: on the other side, the most beautifull Houres carrying garlands
and loose flowers, and making great honor to the goddesse of pleasure;
the flutes and Pipes yeelded out the sweet sound of Lydians, whereby
they pleased the minds of the standers by exceedingly, but the more
pleasing Venus mooved forward more and more, and shaking her head
answered by her motion and gesture, to the sound of the instruments.
For sometimes she would winke gently, sometimes threaten and looke
aspishly, and sometimes dance onely with her eyes: As soone as she was
come before the Judge, she made a signe and token to give him the most
fairest spouse of all the world, if he would prefer her above the
residue of the goddesses. Then the young Phrygian shepheard Paris with
a willing mind delivered the golden Apple to Venus, which was the
victory of beauty.
Why doe ye marvell, ye Orators, ye Lawyers, and Advocates, if many of
our judges now a daies sell their judgements for money, when as in the
beginning of the world one onely Grace corrupted the sentence betweene
God and men, and that one rusticall Judge and shepheard appointed by
the counsell of great Jupiter, sold his judgement for a little
pleasure, which was the cause afterward of the ruine of all his
progeny? By like manner of meane, was sentence given between the noble
Greekes: For the noble and valiant personage Palamedes was convicted
and attainted of treason, by false perswasion and accusation, and
Ulisses being but of base condition, was preferred in Martiall prowesse
above great Ajax. What judgement was there likewise amongst the
Athenian lawyers, sage and expert in all sciences? Was not Socrates who
was preferred by Apollo, above all the wise men in the world, by envy
and malice of wicked persons impoysoned with the herbe Cicuta, as one
that corrupted the youth of the countrey, whom alwaies be kept under by
correction? For we see now a dayes many excellent Philosophers greatly
desire to follow his sect, and by perpetual study to value and revolve
his workes, but to the end I may not be reproved of indignation by any
one that might say: What, shall we suffer an Asse to play the
Philosopher? I will returne to my further purpose.
After the judgement of Paris was ended, Juno and Pallas departed away
angerly, shewing by their gesture, that they would revenge themselves
on Paris, but Venus that was right pleased and glad in her heart,
danced about the Theater with much joy. This done from the top of the
hill through a privy spout, ran a floud of the colour of Saffron, which
fell upon the Goates, and changed their white haire into yellow, with a
sweet odour to all them of the Theater. By and by after by certaine
engines, the ground opened, and swallowed up the hill of wood: and then
behold there came a man of armes through the multitude, demanding by
the consent of the people, the woman who was condemned to the beasts,
and appointed for me to have to doe withall: our bed was finely and
bravely prepared, and covered with silke and other things necessary.
But I, beside the shame to commit this horrible fact, and to pollute my
body with this wicked harlot did greatly feare the danger of death: for
I thought in my selfe, that when she and I were together, the savage
beast appointed to devoure the woman, was not so instructed and taught,
or would so temper his greedinesse, as that hee would teare her in
peeces lying under mee, and spare mee with a regard of mine innocency.
Wherefore I was more carefull for the safeguard of my life, then for
the shame that I should abide, but in the meane season while my master
made ready the bed, all the residue did greatly delight to see the
hunting and pleasantnesse of the triumph, I began to thinke and devise
for my selfe. When I perceived that no man had regard to mee, that was
so tame and gentle an Asse, I stole out of the gate that was next me,
and then I ran away with all force, and came to Cenchris, which is the
most famous towne of all the Carthaginians, bordering upon the Seas
called Ageum, and Saronicum, where is a great and mighty Haven,
frequented with many a sundry Nation. There because I would avoyd the
multitude of the people, I went to a secret place of the Sea coast,
where I laid me down upon the sand, to ease and refresh my selfe, for
the day was past and the Sunne gone downe, and lying in this sort on
the ground, did fall in a sound sleepe.
THE ELEVENTH BOOKE
THE FORTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER
How Apuleius by Roses and prayer returned to his humane shape.
When midnight came that I had slept my first sleepe, I awaked with
suddaine feare, and saw the Moone shining bright, as when shee is at
the full, and seeming as though she leaped out of the Sea. Then thought
I with my selfe, that was the most secret time, when the goddesse Ceres
had most puissance and force, considering that all humane things be
governed by her providence: and not onely all beasts private and tame,
but also all wild and savage beasts be under her protection. And
considering that all bodies in the heavens, the earth and the seas, be
by her increasing motions increased, and by her diminishing motions
diminished: as weary of all my cruell fortune and calamity, I found
good hope and soveraigne remedy, though it were very late, to be
delivered from all my misery, by invocation and prayer, to the
excellent beauty of the Goddesse, whom I saw shining before mine eyes,
wherefore shaking off mine Assie and drowsie sleepe, I arose with a
joyfull face, and mooved by a great affection to purifie my selfe, I
plunged my selfe seven times into the water of the Sea, which number of
seven is conveniable and agreeable to holy and divine things, as the
worthy and sage Philosopher Pythagoras hath declared. Then with a
weeping countenance, I made this Orison to the puissant Goddesse,
saying: O blessed Queene of heaven, whether thou be the Dame Ceres
which art the originall and motherly nource of all fruitfull things in
earth, who after the finding of thy daughter Proserpina, through the
great joy which thou diddest presently conceive, madest barraine and
unfruitfull ground to be plowed and sowne, and now thou inhabitest in
the land of Eleusie; or whether thou be the celestiall Venus, who in
the beginning of the world diddest couple together all kind of things
with an ingendered love, by an eternall propagation of humane kind, art
now worshipped within the Temples of the Ile Paphos, thou which art the
sister of the God Phoebus, who nourishest so many people by the
generation of beasts, and art now adored at the sacred places of
Ephesus, thou which art horrible Proserpina, by reason of the deadly
howlings which thou yeeldest, that hast power to stoppe and put away
the invasion of the hags and Ghoasts which appeare unto men, and to
keepe them downe in the closures of the earth: thou which art
worshipped in divers manners, and doest illuminate all the borders of
the earth by thy feminine shape, thou which nourishest all the fruits
of the world by thy vigor and force; with whatsoever name or fashion it
is lawfull to call upon thee, I pray thee, to end my great travaile and
misery, and deliver mee from the wretched fortune, which had so long
time pursued me. Grant peace and rest if it please thee to my
adversities, for I have endured too much labour and perill. Remoove
from me my shape of mine Asse, and render to me my pristine estate, and
if I have offended in any point of divine Majesty, let me rather dye
then live, for I am full weary of my life. When I had ended this
orison, and discovered my plaints to the Goddesse, I fortuned to fall
asleepe, and by and by appeared unto me a divine and venerable face,
worshipped even of the Gods themselves. Then by little and little I
seemed to see the whole figure of her body, mounting out of the sea and
standing before mee, wherefore I purpose to describe her divine
semblance, if the poverty of my humane speech will suffer me, or her
divine power give me eloquence thereto. First shee had a great
abundance of haire, dispersed and scattered about her neck, on the
crowne of her head she bare many garlands enterlaced with floures, in
the middle of her forehead was a compasse in fashion of a glasse, or
resembling the light of the Moone, in one of her hands she bare
serpents, in the other, blades of corne, her vestiment was of fine
silke yeelding divers colours, sometime yellow, sometime rosie,
sometime flamy, and sometime (which troubled my spirit sore) darke and
obscure, covered with a blacke robe in manner of a shield, and pleated
in most subtill fashion at the skirts of her garments, the welts
appeared comely, whereas here and there the starres glimpsed, and in
the middle of them was placed the Moone, which shone like a flame of
fire, round about the robe was a coronet or garland made with flowers
and fruits. In her right hand shee had a timbrell of brasse, which gave
a pleasant sound, in her left hand shee bare a cup of gold, out of the
mouth whereof the serpent Aspis lifted up his head, with a swelling
throat, her odoriferous feete were covered with shoes interlaced and
wrought with victorious palme. Thus the divine shape breathing out the
pleasant spice of fertill Arabia, disdained not with her divine voyce
to utter these words unto me: Behold Lucius I am come, thy weeping and
prayers hath mooved mee to succour thee. I am she that is the naturall
mother of all things, mistresse and governesse of all the Elements, the
initiall progeny of worlds, chiefe of powers divine, Queene of heaven!
the principall of the Gods celestiall, the light of the goddesses: at
my will the planets of the ayre, the wholesome winds of the Seas, and
the silences of hell be diposed; my name, my divinity is adored
throughout all the world in divers manners, in variable customes and in
many names, for the Phrygians call me the mother of the Gods: the
Athenians, Minerva: the Cyprians, Venus: the Candians, Diana: the
Sicilians Proserpina: the Eleusians, Ceres: some Juno, other Bellona,
other Hecate: and principally the Aethiopians which dwell in the
Orient, and the Aegyptians which are excellent in all kind of ancient
doctrine, and by their proper ceremonies accustome to worship mee, doe
call mee Queene Isis. Behold I am come to take pitty of thy fortune and
tribulation, behold I am present to favour and ayd thee, leave off thy
weeping and lamentation, put away all thy sorrow, for behold the
healthfull day which is ordained by my providence, therefore be ready
to attend to my commandement. This day which shall come after this
night, is dedicated to my service, by an eternall religion, my Priests
and Ministers doe accustome after the tempests of the Sea, be ceased,
to offer in my name a new ship as a first fruit of my Navigation. I
command thee not to prophane or despise the sacrifice in any wise, for
the great Priest shall carry this day following in procession by my
exhortation, a Garland of Roses, next the timbrell of his right hand:
follow thou my procession amongst the people, and when thou commest to
the Priest make as though thou wouldest kisse his hand, but snatch at
the Roses, whereby I will put away the skin and shape of an Asse, which
kind of beast I have long time abhorred and despised, but above all
things beware thou doubt not nor feare any of those things, as hard and
difficill to bee brought to passe, for in the same houre that I am come
to thee, I have commanded the Priest by a vision what he shall doe, and
all the people by my commandement shall be compelled to give thee place
and say nothing! Moreover, thinke not that amongst so faire and joyfull
Ceremonies, and in so good a company that any person shall abhorre thy
ill-favoured and deformed figure, or that any man shall be so hardy, as
to blame and reprove thy suddaine restoration to humane shape, wherby
they should gather or conceive any sinister opinion: and know thou this
of certaine, that the residue of thy life untill the houre of death
shall be bound and subject to me! And think it not an injury to be
alwayes serviceable towards me, since as by my meane and benefit thou
shalt become a man: thou shalt live blessed in this world, thou shalt
live glorious by my guide and protection, and when thou descendest to
Hell, where thou shalt see me shine in that subterene place, shining
(as thou seest me now) in the darkness of Acheron, and raigning in the
deepe profundity of Stix, thou shalt worship me, as one that hath bin
favourable to thee, and if I perceive that thou art obedient to my
commandement, addict to my religion, and merite my divine grace, know
thou, that I will prolong thy dales above the time that the fates have
appointed, and the celestial Planets ordeined.
When the divine Image had spoken these words, she vanished away! By and
by when I awaked, I arose, haveing the members of my bodie mixed with
feare, joy and sweate, and marvailed at the cleare presence of the
puissant goddesse, and being sprinkled with the water of the sea, I
recounted orderly her admonitions and divine commandements. Soone
after, the darknes chased away, and the cleare and golden sunne arose,
when as behold I saw the streets replenished with people going in a
religious sort and in great triumph. All things seemed that day to be
joyfull, as well all manner of beasts and houses, as also the very day
it selfe seemed to rejoyce. For after the hore-frost, ensued the hot
and temperat sun, whereby the little birds weening that the spring time
had bin come, did chirp and sing in their steven melodiously: the
mother of stars, the parent of times, and mistres of all the world: The
fruitfull trees rejoyced at their fertility: The barren and sterill
were contented at their shadow, rendering sweete and pleasant shrills!
The seas were quiet from winds and tempests: the heaven had chaced away
the clouds, and appeared faire and cleare with his proper light. Behold
then more and more appeared the pomps and processions, attired in
regall manner and singing joyfully: One was girded about the middle
like a man of armes: Another bare and spare, and had a cloake and
high-shooes like a hunter! another was attired in a robe of silke, and
socks of gold, having his haire laid out, and dressed in forme of a
woman! There was another ware legge-harnesse, and bare a target, a
sallet, and a speare like a martial souldier: after him marched one
attired in purple with vergers before him like a magistrate! after him
followed one with a maurell, a staffe, a paire of pantofles, and with a
gray beard, signifying a philosopher: after him went one with lime,
betokening a fowler, another with hookes declaring a fisher: I saw
there a meeke and tame beare, which in matron habite was carried on a
stoole: An Ape with a bonet on his head, and covered with lawne,
resemling a shepheard, and bearing a cup of gold in his hand: an Asse
which had wings glewed to his backe, and went after an old man, whereby
you would judge the one to be Pegasus, and the other Bellephoron.
Amongst the pleasures and popular delectations, which wandered hither
and thither, you might see the pompe of the goddesse triumphantly march
forward: The woman attired in white vestiments, and rejoicing, in that
they bare garlands and flowers upon their heads, bedspread the waies
with hearbes, which they bare in their aprons, where this regall and
devout procession should passe: Other caried glasses on their backes,
to testifie obeisance to the goddess which came after. Other bare combs
of Ivory, and declared by their gesture and motions of their armes,
that they were ordained and readie to dresse the goddesse: Others
dropped in the wayes as they went Balme and other pretious ointments:
Then came a great number, as well of men as women, with Candels,
torches, and other lights, doing honour to the celestiall goddesse:
After that sounded the musical harmony of instruments: then came a
faire companie of youth, apparelled in white vestiments, singing both
meter and verse, with a comely grade which some studious Poet had made
in honour of the Muses: In the meane season, arrived the blowers of
trumpets, which were dedicated unto Serapes, and to the temple before
them were officers and beadles, preparing roome for the goddess to
passe. Then came the great company of men and women, which had taken
divine orders, whose garments glistered all the streets over. The women
had their haire annointed and their heads covered with linnen: but the
men had their crownes shaven, which were the terrene stars of the
goddesse, holding in their hand instruments of brasse, silver and gold,
which rendered a pleasant sound.
The principall Priests which were apparelled with white surplesses
hanging downe to the ground, bare the relikes of the puissant goddesse.
One carried in his hand a light, not unlike to those which we used in
our houses, saving that in the middle thereof appeared a bole which
rendred a more bright flame. The second attired like the other bare in
his hand an Altar, which the goddesse her selfe named the succor of
nations. The third held a tree of palme with leaves of gold, and the
verge of Mercurie. The fourth shewed out a token of equitie by his left
hand, which was deformed in every place, signifiing thereby more
equitie then by the right hand. The same Priest carried a round vessell
of gold, in forme of a cap. The fifth bare a van, wrought with springs
of gold, and another carried a vessell for wine: By and by after the
goddesse followed a foot as men do, and specially Mercurie, the
messenger of the goddesse infernall and supernall, with his face
sometime blacke, sometime faire, lifting up the head of the dogges
Annubis, and bearing in his left hand, his verge, and in his right
hand, the branches of a palme tree, after whom followed a cow with an
upright gate, representing the figure of the great goddesse, and he
that guided her, marched on with much gravity. Another carried after
the secrets of their religion, closed in a coffer. There was one that
bare on his stomacke a figure of his god, not formed like any beast,
bird, savage thing or humane shape, but made by a new invention,
whereby was signified that such a religion should not be discovered or
revealed to any person. There was a vessel wrought with a round
bottome, haveing on the one side, pictures figured like unto the manner
of the Egyptians, and on the other side was an eare, whereupon stood
the Serpent Aspis, holding out his scaly necke. Finally, came he which
was appointed to my good fortun according to the promise of the
goddesse. For the great Priest which bare the restoration of my human
shape, by the commandement of the goddes, Approached more and more,
bearing in his left hand the timbrill, and in the other a garland of
Roses to give me, to the end I might be delivered from cruel fortune,
which was alwaies mine enemie, after the sufferance of so much
calamitie and paine, and after the endurance of so manie perilles: Then
I not returning hastilie, by reason of sodaine joye, lest I should
disturbe the quiet procession with mine importunitie, but going softly
through the prease of the people, which gave me place on every side,
went after the Priest. The priest being admonished the night before, as
I might well perceive stood still and holding out his hand, thrust out
the garland of roses into my mouth, I (trembling) devoured with a great
affection: And as soone as I had eaten them, I was not deceived of the
promise made unto me. For my deforme and Assie face abated, and first
the rugged haire of my body fell off, my thick skin waxed soft and
tender, the hooves of my feet changed into toes, my hands returned
againe, my neck grew short, my head and mouth began round, my long
eares were made little, my great and stonie teeth waxed lesse like the
teeth of men, and my tayle which combred me most, appeared no where:
then the people began to marvaile, and the religious honoured the
goddesse, for so evident a miracle, they wondered at the visions which
they saw in the night, and the facilitie of my reformation, whereby
they rendered testimonie of so great a benefit which I received of the
goddesse. When I saw my selfe in such estate, I stood still a good
space and said nothing, for I could not tell what to say, nor what word
I shoulde first speake, nor what thanks I should render to the
goddesse, but the great Priest understanding all my fortune and
miserie, by divine advertisement, commanded that one should give me
garments to cover me: Howbeit as soone as I was transformed from an
asse to my humane shape, I hid the privitie of my body with my hands as
shame and necessity compelled mee. Then one of the company put off his
upper robe and put it on my backe: which done, the Priest looked upon
me, with a sweete and benigne voice, gan say in this sort: O my friend
Lucius, after the endurance of so many labours, and the escape of so
many tempests of fortune, thou art at length come to the port and haven
of rest and mercy: neither did thy noble linage, thy dignity, thy
doctrine, or any thing prevaile, but that thou hast endured so many
servil pleasures, by a little folly of thy youthfullnes, whereby thou
hast had a sinister reward for thy unprosperous curiositie, but
howsoever the blindnes of fortune tormented thee in divers dangers: so
it is, that now unwares to her, thou art come to this present
felicitie: let fortune go, and fume with fury in another place, let her
finde some other matter to execute her cruelty, for fortune hath no
puissance against them which serve and honour our goddesse. For what
availed the theeves: the beasts savage: thy great servitude: the ill
and dangerous waits: the long passages: the feare of death every day?
Know thou, that now thou art safe, and under the protection of her, who
by her cleare light doth lighten the other gods: wherefore rejoyce and
take a convenable countenance to thy white habit, follow the pomp of
this devout and honorable procession, to the end that such which be not
devout to the Goddes, may see and acknowledge their errour. Behold
Lucius, thou art delivered from so great miseries, by the providence of
the goddesse Isis, rejoyce therefore and triumph of the victory of
fortune; to the end thou maist live more safe and sure, make thy selfe
one of this holy order, dedicate thy minde to the Obsequy of our
Religion, and take upon thee a voluntary yoake of ministrie: And when
thou beginnest to serve and honour the goddes, then thou shalt feele
the fruit of thy liberty: After that the great Priest had prophesied in
this manner, with often breathings, he made a conclusion of his words:
Then I went amongst the company of the rest and followed the
procession: everie one of the people knew me, and pointing at me with
their fingers, said in this sort: Behold him who is this day
transformed into a man by the puissance of the soveraigne goddesse,
verily he is blessed and most blessed that hath merited so great grace
from heaven, as by the innocencie of his former life, and as it were by
a new regeneration is reserved to the obsequie of the goddesse. In the
meane season by little and little we approached nigh unto the sea cost,
even to that place where I lay the night before being an Asse. There
after the images and reliques were orderly disposed, the great Priest
compassed about with divers pictures according to the fashion of the
Aegyptians, did dedicate and consecrate with certaine prayers a fair
ship made very cunningly, and purified the same with a torch, an egge,
and sulphur; the saile was of white linnen cloath, whereon was written
certaine letters, which testified the navigation to be prosperous, the
mast was of a great length, made of a Pine tree, round and very
excellent with a shining top, the cabin was covered over with coverings
of gold, and all the shippe was made of Citron tree very faire; then
all the people as well religious as prophane tooke a great number of
Vannes, replenished with odours and pleasant smells and threw them into
the sea mingled with milke, untill the ship was filled up with large
gifts and prosperous devotions, when as with a pleasant wind it
launched out into the deep. But when they had lost the sight of the
ship, every man caried againe that he brought, and went toward the
temple in like pompe and order as they came to the sea side. When we
were come to the temple, the great priest and those which were deputed
to carrie the divine figures, but especially those which had long time
bin worshippers of the religion, went into the secret chamber of the
goddesse, where they put and placed the images according to their
ordor. This done, one of the company which was a scribe or interpreter
of letters, who in forme of a preacher stood up in a chaire before the
place of the holy college, and began to reade out of a booke, and to
interpret to the great prince, the senate, and to all the noble order
of chivalry, and generally to all the Romane people, and to all such as
be under the jurisdiction of Rome, these words following (Laois
Aphesus) which signified the end of their divin service and that it was
lawfull for every man to depart, whereat all the people gave a great
showt, and replenished with much joy, bare all kind of hearbs and
garlands of flowers home to their houses, kissing and imbracing the
steps where the goddesse passed: howbeit I could not doe as the rest,
for my mind would not suffer me to depart one foot away, so attentiv
was I to behold the beauty of the goddesse, with remembrance of the
great miserie I had endured.
THE FORTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER
How the parents and friends of Apuleius heard news that he was alive
and in health.
In the mean season newes was carried into my countrey (as swift as the
flight of birds, or as the blast of windes) of the grace and benefit
which I received of the goddesse, and of my fortune worthy to be had in
memory. Then my parents friends and servants of our house understanding
that I was not dead, as they were falsely informed, came towards me
with great diligence to see me, as a man raised from death to life: and
I which never thought to see them againe, was as joyfull as they,
accepting and taking in good part their honest gifts and oblations that
they gave, to the intent I might buy such things as was necessarie for
my body: for after I had made relation unto them of all my pristine
miserie, and present joyes, I went before the face of the goddesse and
hired me a house within the cloister of the temple to the end I might
continually be ready to the service of the goddesse, and ordinarily
frequent the company of the priests, whereby I would wholy become
devout to the goddesse, and an inseparable worshipper of her divine
name: It fortuned that the goddesse appeared to me oftetimes in the
night perswading and commanding me to take the order of her religion,
but I, though I was indued with a desirous good will, yet the feare of
the same withheld me considering her obeysance was hard and difficile,
the chastitie of the Priests intolerable, and the life fraile and
subject to manie inconveniences. Being thus in doubt, I refrained my
selfe from all those things as seemed impossible.
On a night the great priest appeared unto me, presenting his lap full
of treasure, and when I demanded what it signified, he answered, that
it was sent me from the countrey of Thessaly, and that a servant of
mine named Candidus was arived likewise: when I was awake, I mused in
my selfe what this vision should pretend, considering I had never any
servant called by that name: but what soever it did signifie, this I
verely thought, that it was a foreshew of gaine and prosperous chance:
while I was thus astonied I went to the temple, and taried there till
the opening of the gates, then I went in and began to pray before the
face of the goddesse, the Priest prepared and set the divine things of
every Altar, and pulled out the fountaine and holy vessell with
solempne supplication. Then they began to sing the mattens of the
morning, testifying thereby the houre of the prime. By and by behold
arived my servant which I had left in the country, when Fotis by errour
made me an Asse, bringing with him my horse, recovered by her through
certaine signes and tokens which I had upon my backe. Then I perceived
the interpretation of my dreame, by reason that beside the promise of
gaine, my white horse was restored to me, which was signified by the
argument of my servant Candidus.
This done I retired to the service of the goddesse in hope of greater
benefits, considering I had received a signe and token, whereby my
courage increased every day more and more to take upon me the orders
and sacraments of the temple: insomuch that I oftentimes communed with
the Priest, desiring him greatly to give me the degree of the religion,
but he which was a man of gravitie, and well renowned in the order of
priesthood, deferred my affection from day to day, with comfort and
better hope, as parents commonly bridle the desires of their children,
when they attempt or indeavour any unprofitable thing, saying, that the
day when any one should be admitted into their order is appointed by
the goddesse, the Priest which should minister the sacrifice is chosen
by her providence, and the necessary charges of the ceremonies is
alotted by her commandement, all which things he willed me to attend
with marvailous patience, and that I should beware either of too much
hastinesse, or too great slacknesse, considering that there was like
danger, if being called I should delay: or not called I should be
hasty: moreover he said that there was none of his company either of so
desperate a mind, or so rash and hardy, as to enterprise any thing
without the commandernent of the goddesse, whereby he should commit a
deadly offence, considering that it was in her power to damne and save
all persons, and if any were at the point of death, and in the way to
damnation, so that he were capable to receive the secrets of the
goddesse, it was in her power by divine providence to reduce him to the
path of health, as by a certaine kind of regeneration: Finally he said
that I must attend the celestiall precept, although it was evident and
plaine, that the goddesse had already vouchsafed to call and appoint me
to her ministery, and to will me refraine from prophane and unlawfull
meates, as those Priests which were already received, to the end I
might come more apt and cleane to the knowledge of the secrets of
religion. Then was I obedient unto these words, and attentive with meek
quietnesse, and probable taciturnity, I daily served at the temple: in
the end the wholesome gentlenesse of the goddesse did nothing deceive
me, for in the night she appeared to me in a vision, shewing that the
day was come which I had wished for so long, she told me what provision
and charges I should be at, and how that she had appointed her
principallest Priest Mythra to be minister with me in my sacrifices.
When I heard these divine commandements, I greatly rejoyced: and arose
before day to speake with the great Priest, whom I fortuned to espie
comming out of his chamber: Then I saluted him, and thought with my
selfe to aske and demand his counsell with a bold courage, but as soone
as he perceived me, he began first to say: O Lucius now know I well
that thou art most happy and blessed, whom the divine goddesse doth so
greatly accept with mercy, why dost thou delay? Behold the day which
thou desiredst when as thou shalt receive at my hands the order of
religion, and know the most pure secrets of the gods, whereupon the old
man tooke me by the hand, and lead me to the gate of the great temple,
where at the first entrie he made a solempne celebration, and after
morning sacrifice ended, brought out of the secret place of the temple
books, partly written with unknown characters, and partly painted with
figures of beasts declaring briefly every sentence, with tops and
tailes, turning in fashion of a wheele, which were strange and
impossible to be read of the prophane people: There he interpreted to
me such things as were necessary to the use and preparation of mine
order. This done, I gave charge to certaine of my companions to buy
liberally, whatsoever was needfull and convenient, then he brought me
to the next bains accompanied with all the religious sort, and
demanding pardon of the goddesse, washed me and purified my body,
according to custome. After this, when noone approached, he brought me
backe againe to the temple, presented me before the face of the
goddesse, giving a charge of certaine secret things unlawfull to be
uttered, and commanding me, and generally all the rest, to fast by the
space of ten continuall daies, without eating of any beast, or drinking
any wine, which thing I observed with a marvellous continencie. Then
behold the day approached, when as the sacrifice should be done, and
when night came there arrived on every coast, a great multitude of
Priests, who according to their order offered me many presents and
gifts: then was all the Laity and prophane people commanded to depart,
and when they had put on my back a linnen robe, they brought me to the
most secret and sacred place of all the temple. You would peradventure
demand (you studious reader) what was said and done there, verely I
would tell you if it were lawfull for me to tell, you should know if it
were convenient for you to heare, but both thy eares, and my tongue
shall incur the like paine of rash curiositie: Howbeit, I will content
thy mind for this present time, which peradventure is somewhat
religious and given to some devotion, listen therefore and beleeve it
to be true: Thou shalt understand that I approached neere unto Hell,
even to the gates of Proserpina, and after that, I was ravished
throughout all the Element, I returned to my proper place: About
midnight I saw the Sun shine, I saw likewise the gods celestiall and
gods infernall, before whom I presented my selfe, and worshipped them:
Behold now have I told thee, which although thou hast heard, yet it is
necessarie thou conceale it; this have I declared without offence, for
the understanding of the prophane.
When morning came, and that the solemnities were finished, I came forth
sanctified with xii. Stoles and in a religious habit, whereof I am not
forbidden to speake, considering that many persons saw me at that time:
there I was commanded to stand upon a seate of wood, which stood in the
middle of the temple, before the figure and remembrance of the
goddesse; my vestiment was of fine linnen, covered and embroidered with
flowers. I had a pretious Cope upon my shoulders hanging downe to the
ground, whereon were beasts wrought of divers colours as Indian
dragons, and Hiperborian Griphons, whom in forme of birds, the other
world doth ingender; the Priests commonly call such a habit, a
celestiall Stole: in my right hand I carried a light torch, and a
garland of flowers upon my head, with Palme leaves sprouting out on
every side: I was adorned like unto the Sun, and made in fashion of an
Image, in such sort that all the people compassed about to behold me:
then they began to solemnize the feast of the nativitie, and the new
procession with sumptuous bankets and delicate meates: the third day
was likewise celebrated with like ceremonies with a religious dinner,
and with all the consummation of the order: when I had continued there
a good space, I conceived a marvailous great pleasure and consolation
in beholding ordinarily the Image of the goddesse, who at length
admonished me to depart homeward, not without rendring of thanks, which
although it were not sufficient, yet they were according to my power.
Howbeit I could unneth be perswaded to depart, before I had fallen
prostrate before the face of the goddesse, and wiped her steps with my
face, whereby I began so greatly to weepe and sigh that my words were
interrupted, and as devouring my prayer, I began to say in this sort: O
holy and blessed dame, the perpetuall comfort of humane kind, who by
thy bounty and grace nourishest all the world, and hearest a great
affection to the adversities of the miserable, as a loving mother thou
takest no rest, neither art thou idle at any time in giving thy
benefits, and succoring all men, as well on land as sea; thou art she
that puttest away all stormes and dangers from mans life by thy right
hand, whereby likewise thou restrainest the fatall dispositions,
appeasest the great tempests of fortune and keepest backe the course of
the stars: the gods supernall doe honour thee: the gods infernall have
thee in reverence: thou environest all the world, thou givest light to
the Sunne, thou governest the world, thou treadest downe the power of
hell: By thy meane the times returne, the Planets rejoyce, the Elements
serve: at thy commandment the winds do blow, the clouds increase, the
seeds prosper, and the fruits prevaile, the birds of the aire, the
beasts of the hill, the serpents of the den, and the fishes of the sea,
do tremble at thy majesty, but my spirit is not able to give thee
sufficient praise, my patrimonie is unable to satisfie thy sacrifice,
my voice hath no power to utter that which I thinke, no if I had a
thousand mouths and so many tongues: Howbeit as a good religious
person, and according to my estate, I will alwaies keepe thee in
remembrance and close thee within my breast. When I had ended mine
orison, I went to embrace the great Priest Mythra my spirituall father,
and to demand his pardon, considering I was unable to recompence the
good which he had done to me: after great greeting and thanks I
departed from him to visit my parents and friends; and within a while
after by the exhortation of the goddesse, I made up my packet, and
tooke shipping toward the Citie of Rome, where with a prosperous winde
I arrived about the xii. day of December. And the greatest desire that
I had there, was daily to make my praiers to the soveraigne goddesse
Isis, who by reason of the place where her temple was builded, was
called Campensis, and continually adored of the people of Rome. Her
minister and worshipper was I, howbeit I was a stranger to her Church,
and unknowne to her religion there.
When the yeare was ended, and the goddesse warned me againe to receive
this new order and consecration, I marvailed greatly what it should
signifie, and what should happen, considering that I was a sacred
person already, but it fortuned that while I partly reasoned with my
selfe, and partly examining the thing with the Priests and Bishops,
there came a new and marvailous thought in my mind, that is to say, I
was onely religious to the goddesse Isis, but not sacred to the
religion of great Osiris the soveraigne father of all the goddesses,
between whom, although there was a religious unitie and concord, yet
there was a great difference of order and ceremony. And because it was
necessary that I should likewise be a minister unto Osiris, there was
no long delay: for in the night after, appeared unto me one of that
order, covered with linnen robes, holding in his hands speares wrapped
in Ivie, and other things not convenient to declare, which then he left
in my chamber, and sitting in my seate, recited to me such things as
were necessary for the sumptuous banket of mine entrie. And to the end
I might know him againe, he shewed me how the ankle of his left foote
was somewhat maimed, which caused him a little to halt.
After that I manifestly knew the will of the God Osiris, when mattins
was ended, I went from one to another, to find him out which had the
halting marke on his foote, according as I learned by my vision; at
length I found it true: for I perceived one of the company of the
Priests who had not onely the token of his foote, but the stature and
habite of his body, resembling in every point as he appeared in the
night: he was called Asinius Marcellus, a name not much disagreeing
from my transformation. By and by I went to him, which knew well enough
all the matter, as being monished by like precept in the night: for the
night before as he dressed the flowers and garlands about the head of
the god Osiris, he understood by the mouth of the image which told the
predestinations of all men, how he had sent a poore man of Madura, to
whom he should minister his sacraments, to the end hee should receive a
reward by divine providence, and the other glory, for his vertuous
studies. When I saw my selfe this deputed unto religion, my desire was
stopped by reason of povertie, for I had spent a great part of my goods
in travell and peregrination, but most of all in the Citie of Rome,
whereby my low estate withdrew me a great while.
In the end being oft times stirred forward, not without great trouble
of mind, I was constrained to sell my robe for a little money: howbeit
sufficient for all my affaires. Then the Priest spake unto me saying,
How is it that for a little pleasure thou art not afraid to sell thy
vestiments, and entring into so great ceremonies, fearest to fall into
povertie? Prepare thy selfe, and abstaine from all animall meats, as
beasts and fish. In the meane season I frequented the sacrifices of
Serapis, which were done in the night, which thing gave me great
comfort to my peregrination, and ministred unto me more plentifull
living, considering I gained some money in haunting the court, by
reason of my Latin tongue.
Immediately after I was eftsoones called and admonished by the god
Osiris, to receive a third order of religion. Then I was greatly
astonied, because I could not tell what this new vision signified, or
what the intent of the celestiall god was, doubting least the former
Priests had given me ill counsell, and fearing that they had not
faithfully instructed me: being in this manner as it were incensed the
god Osiris appeared to me the night following, and giving me admonition
said, There is no occasion why thou shouldest be afraid with so often
order of religion, as though there were somewhat omitted, but that thou
shouldest rather rejoyce, since as it hath pleased the gods to call
thee three times, when as there was never yet any person that atchieved
to the order but once: wherefore thou maist thinke thy selfe happy for
so great benefits. And know thou that the religion which thou must now
receive, is right necessary, if thou meane to persever in the
worshipping of the goddesse, and to make solempnity on the festivall
day with the blessed habite, which thing shalt be a glory and renowne
to thee.
After this sort, the divine majesty perswaded me in my sleepe,
whereupon by and by I went towards the Priest, and declared all that
which I had seene, then I fasted ten dayes according to the custome,
and of mine owne proper will I abstained longer then I was commanded:
and verely I did nothing repent of the paine which I had taken, and of
the charges which I was at, considering that the divine providence had
given me such an order, that I gained much money in pleading of causes:
Finally after a few dayes, the great god Osiris appeared to me in the
night, not disguised in any other forme, but in his owne essence,
commanding me that I should be an Advocate in the court, and not feare
the slander and envie of ill persons, which beare me stomacke and
grudge by reason of my doctrine, which I had gotten by much labour:
moreover, he would not that I should be any longer of the number of his
Priests, but he allotted me to be one of the Decurions and Senatours:
and after he appointed me a place within the ancient pallace, which was
erected in the time of Silla, where I executed my office in great joy
with a shaven Crowne.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
